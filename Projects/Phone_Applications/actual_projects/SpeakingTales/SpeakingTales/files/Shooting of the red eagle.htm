<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Shooting
of the red eagle</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A man in buckskins sat upon the top of a little
hillock. The setting sun shone bright upon a strong bow in his hand. His face
was turned toward the round camp ground at the foot of the hill. He had walked
a long journey hither. He was waiting for the chieftain's men to spy him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon four strong men ran forth from the center
wigwam toward the hillock, where sat the man with the long bow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He is the avenger come to shoot the red
eagle,&quot; cried the runners to each other as they bent forward swinging
their elbows together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They reached the side of the stranger, but he
did not heed them. Proud and silent he gazed upon the cone-shaped wigwams
beneath him. Spreading a handsomely decorated buffalo robe before the man, two
of the warriors lifted him by each shoulder and placed him gently on it. Then
the four men took, each, a corner of the blanket and carried the stranger, with
long proud steps, toward the chieftain's teepee. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ready to greet the stranger, the tall chieftain
stood at the entrance way. &quot;How, you are the avenger with the magic
arrow!&quot; said he, extending to him a smooth soft hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, great chieftain!&quot; replied the
man, holding long the chieftain's hand. Entering the teepee, the chieftain
motioned the young man to the right side of the doorway, while he sat down opposite
him with a center fire burning between them. Wordless, like a bashful Indian
maid, the avenger ate in silence the food set before him on the ground in front
of his crossed shins. When he had finished his meal he handed the empty bowl to
the chieftain's wife, saying, &quot;Mother-in-law, here is your dish!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Han, my son!&quot; answered the woman,
taking the bowl. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With the magic arrow in his quiver the stranger
felt not in the least too presuming in addressing the woman as his
mother-in-law. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Complaining of fatigue, he covered his face with
his blanket and soon within the chieftain's teepee he lay fast asleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The young man is not handsome after
all!&quot; whispered the woman in her husband's ear. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah, but after he has killed the red eagle
he will seem handsome enough!&quot; answered the chieftain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That night the star men in their burial
procession in the sky reached the low northern horizon, before the center fires
within the teepees had flickered out. The ringing laughter which had floated up
through the smoke lapels was now hushed, and only the distant howling of wolves
broke the quiet of the village. But the lull between midnight and dawn was
short indeed. Very early the oval-shaped door-flaps were thrust aside and many
brown faces peered out of the wigwams toward the top of the highest bluff. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the sun rose up out of the east. The red
painted avenger stood ready within the camp ground for the flying of the red
eagle. He appeared, that terrible bird! He hovered over the round village as if
he could pounce down upon it and devour the whole tribe. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the first arrow shot up into the sky the
anxious watchers thrust a hand quickly over their half-uttered
&quot;hinnu!&quot; The second and the third arrows flew upward but missed by a
wide space the red eagle soaring with lazy indifference over the little man
with the long bow. All his arrows he spent in vain. &quot;Ah! my blanket
brushed my elbow and shifted the course of my arrow!&quot; said the stranger as
the people gathered around him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>During this happening, a woman on horseback
halted her pony at the chieftain's teepee. It was no other than the young woman
who cut loose the tree-bound captive! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While she told the story the chieftain listened
with downcast face. &quot;I passed him on my way. He is near!&quot; she ended. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Indignant at the bold impostor, the wrathful
eyes of the chieftain snapped fire like red cinders in the night time. His lips
were closed. At length to the woman he said: &quot;How, you have done me a good
deed.&quot; Then with quick decision he gave command to a fleet horseman to
meet the avenger. &quot;Clothe him in these my best buckskins,&quot; said he,
pointing to a bundle within the wigwam. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the meanwhile strong men seized Iktomi and
dragged him by his long hair to the hilltop. There upon a mock-pillared grave
they bound him hand and feet. Grown-ups and children sneered and hooted at
Iktomi's disgrace. For a half-day he lay there, the laughing-stock of the
people. Upon the arrival of the real avenger, Iktomi was released and chased
away beyond the outer limits of the camp ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the following morning at daybreak, peeped the
people out of half-open door-flaps. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There again in the midst of the large camp
ground was a man in beaded buckskins. In his hand was a strong bow and
red-tipped arrow. Again the big red eagle appeared on the edge of the bluff. He
plumed his feathers and flapped his huge wings. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young man crouched low to the ground. He
placed the arrow on the bow, drawing a poisoned flint for the eagle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bird rose into the air. He moved his
outspread wings one, two, three times and lo! the eagle tumbled from the great
height and fell heavily to the earth. An arrow stuck in his breast! He was
dead! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So quick was the hand of the avenger, so sure
his sight, that no one had seen the arrow fly from his long bent bow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In awe and amazement the village was dumb. And
when the avenger, plucking a red eagle feather, placed it in his black hair, a
loud shout of the people went up to the sky. Then hither and thither ran
singing men and women making a great feast for the avenger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus he won the beautiful Indian princess who
never tired of telling to her children the story of the big red eagle. </span></p>
