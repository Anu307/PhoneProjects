<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi
and the fawn</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In one of his wanderings through the wooded
lands, Iktomi saw a rare bird sitting high in a tree-top. Its long fan-like
tail feathers had caught all the beautiful colors of the rainbow. Handsome in
the glistening summer sun sat the bird of rainbow plumage. Iktomi hurried
hither with his eyes fast on the bird. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He stood beneath the tree looking long and
wistfully at the peacock's bright feathers. At length he heaved a sigh and
began: &quot;Oh, I wish I had such pretty feathers! How I wish I were not I! If
only I were a handsome feathered creature how happy I would be! I'd be so glad
to sit upon a very high tree and bask in the summer sun like you!&quot; said he
suddenly, pointing his bony finger up toward the peacock, who was eyeing the
stranger below, turning his head from side to side. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I beg of you make me into a bird with
green and purple feathers like yours!&quot; implored Iktomi, tired now of
playing the brave in beaded buckskins. The peacock then spoke to Iktomi:
&quot;I have a magic power. My touch will change you in a moment into the most
beautiful peacock if you can keep one condition.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes! yes!&quot; shouted Iktomi, jumping up
and down, patting his lips with his palm, which caused his voice to vibrate in
a peculiar fashion. &quot;Yes! yes! I could keep ten conditions if only you
would change me into a bird with long, bright tail feathers. Oh, I am so ugly!
I am so tired of being myself! Change me! Do!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hereupon the peacock spread out both his wings,
and scarce moving them, he sailed slowly down upon the ground. Right beside
Iktomi he alighted. Very low in Iktomi's ear the peacock whispered, &quot;Are
you willing to keep one condition, though hard it be?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes! yes! I've told you ten of them if
need be!&quot; exclaimed Iktomi, with some impatience. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then I pronounce you a handsome feathered
bird. No longer are you Iktomi the mischief-maker.&quot; Saying this the
peacock touched Iktomi with the tips of his wings. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi vanished at the touch. There stood
beneath the tree two handsome peacocks. While one of the pair strutted about
with a head turned aside as if dazzled by his own bright-tinted tail feathers,
the other bird soared slowly upward. He sat quiet and unconscious of his gay
plumage. He seemed content to perch there on a large limb in the warm sunshine.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a little while the vain peacock, dizzy
with his bright colors, spread out his wings and lit on the same branch with
the elder bird. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;how hard to
fly! Brightly tinted feathers are handsome, but I wish they were light enough
to fly!&quot; Just there the elder bird interrupted him. &quot;That is the one
condition. Never try to fly like other birds. Upon the day you try to fly you
shall be changed into your former self.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, what a shame that bright feathers
cannot fly into the sky!&quot; cried the peacock. Already he grew restless. He
longed to soar through space. He yearned to fly above the trees high upward to
the sun. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, there I see a flock of birds flying
thither! Oh! oh!&quot; said he, flapping his wings, &quot;I must try my wings!
I am tired of bright tail feathers. I want to try my wings.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, no!&quot; clucked the elder bird. The
flock of chattering birds flew by with whirring wings. &quot;Oop! oop!&quot;
called some to their mates. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Possessed by an irrepressible impulse the Iktomi
peacock called out, &quot;He! I want to come! Wait for me!&quot; and with that
he gave a lunge into the air. The flock of flying feathers wheeled about and
lowered over the tree whence came the peacock's cry. Only one rare bird sat on
the tree, and beneath, on the ground, stood a brave in brown buckskins. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am my old self again!&quot; groaned
Iktomi in a sad voice. &quot;Make me over, pretty bird. Try me this once
again!&quot; he pleaded in vain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Old Iktomi wants to fly! Ah! We cannot
wait for him!&quot; sang the birds as they flew away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Muttering unhappy vows to himself, Iktomi had
not gone far when he chanced upon a bunch of long slender arrows. One by one
they rose in the air and shot a straight line over the prairie. Others shot up
into the blue sky and were soon lost to sight. Only one was left. He was making
ready for his flight when Iktomi rushed upon him and wailed, &quot;I want to be
an arrow! Make me into an arrow! I want to pierce the blue Blue overhead. I
want to strike yonder summer sun in its center. Make me into an arrow!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Can you keep a condition? One condition,
though hard it be?&quot; the arrow turned to ask. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; shouted Iktomi, delighted.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hereupon the slender arrow tapped him gently
with his sharp flint beak. There was no Iktomi, but two arrows stood ready to
fly. &quot;Now, young arrow, this is the one condition. Your flight must always
be in a straight line. Never turn a curve nor jump about like a young
fawn,&quot; said the arrow magician. He spoke slowly and sternly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At once he set about to teach the new arrow how
to shoot in a long straight line. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is the way to pierce the Blue
overhead,&quot; said he; and off he spun high into the sky. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While he was gone a herd of deer came trotting
by. Behind them played the young fawns together. They frolicked about like
kittens. They bounced on all fours like balls. Then they pitched forward,
kicking their heels in the air. The Iktomi arrow watched them so happy on the
ground. Looking quickly up into the sky, he said in his heart, &quot;The
magician is out of sight. I'll just romp and frolic with these fawns until he
returns. Fawns! Friends, do not fear me. I want to jump and leap with you. I
long to be happy as you are,&quot; said he. The young fawns stopped with stiff
legs and stared at the speaking arrow with large brown wondering eyes.
&quot;See! I can jump as well as you!&quot; went on Iktomi. He gave one tiny
leap like a fawn. All of a sudden the fawns snorted with extended nostrils at
what they beheld. There among them stood Iktomi in brown buckskins, and the
strange talking arrow was gone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! I am myself. My old self!&quot; cried
Iktomi, pinching himself and plucking imaginary pieces out of his jacket. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hin-hin-hin! I wanted to fly!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The real arrow now returned to the earth. He
alighted very near Iktomi. From the high sky he had seen the fawns playing on
the green. He had seen Iktomi make his one leap, and the charm was broken. Iktomi
became his former self. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Arrow, my friend, change me once
more!&quot; begged Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, no more,&quot; replied the arrow. Then
away he shot through the air in the direction his comrades had flown. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By this time the fawns gathered close around
Iktomi. They poked their noses at him trying to know who he was. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi's tears were like a spring shower. A new
desire dried them quickly away. Stepping boldly to the largest fawn, he looked
closely at the little brown spots all over the furry face. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, fawn! What beautiful brown spots on
your face! Fawn, dear little fawn, can you tell me how those brown spots were
made on your face?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the fawn. &quot;When I was
very, very small, my mother marked them on my face with a red hot fire. She dug
a large hole in the ground and made a soft bed of grass and twigs in it. Then
she placed me gently there. She covered me over with dry sweet grass and piled
dry cedars on top. From a neighbor's fire she brought hither a red, red ember.
This she tucked carefully in at my head. This is how the brown spots were made
on my face.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, fawn, my friend, will you do the same
for me? Won't you mark my face with brown, brown spots just like yours?&quot;
asked Iktomi, always eager to be like other people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes. I can dig the ground and fill it with
dry grass and sticks. If you will jump into the pit, I'll cover you with sweet
smelling grass and cedar wood,&quot; answered the fawn. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Say,&quot; interrupted Ikto, &quot;will
you be sure to cover me with a great deal of dry grass and twigs? You will make
sure that the spots will be as brown as those you wear.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, yes. I'll pile up grass and willows
once oftener than my mother did.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now let us dig the hole, pull the grass,
and gather sticks,&quot; cried Iktomi in glee. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus with his own hands he aids in making his
grave. After the hole was dug and cushioned with grass, Iktomi, muttering
something about brown spots, leaped down into it. Lengthwise, flat on his back,
he lay. While the fawn covered him over with cedars, a far-away voice came up
through them, &quot;Brown, brown spots to wear forever!&quot; A red ember was
tucked under the dry grass. Off scampered the fawns after their mothers; and
when a great distance away they looked backward. They saw a blue smoke rising,
writhing upward till it vanished in the blue ether. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Is that Iktomi's spirit?&quot; asked one
fawn of another. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No! I think he would jump out before he could burn
into smoke and cinders,&quot; answered his comrade.</span></p>
