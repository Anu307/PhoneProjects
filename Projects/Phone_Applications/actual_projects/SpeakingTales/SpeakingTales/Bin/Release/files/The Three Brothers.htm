Three Brothers</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal;"'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There
were, once upon a time, three brothers, and the third was a fool. And in their
little garden grew golden apple-trees with golden apples, and not far off lived
a hog that had taken a fancy to these apples. So the father sent his sons into
the garden to guard the trees. The eldest went first, and sat and sat and
watched and watched till he was tired of watching, and fell asleep. Then the
hog crept in, and dug and dug till he had digged up an apple-tree, which he ate
up, and then went his way. The father got up next morning and counted his
apple-trees, and one of them was gone. The next night the father sent the
second son to watch. He waited and watched till he also fell asleep, and the
hog came again and dug up and ate another golden apple-tree and made off. The
next morning the father got up again and counted his trees, and another was
gone. Then the fool said, “Dad, let me go too!” But the father said, “Oh, fool,
fool, wherefore shouldst thou go? Thy wise brethren have watched to no purpose,
what canst thou do?”––“Hoity-toity!” said the fool; “give me a gun, and I’ll go
all the same.” His father wouldn’t give him a gun, so he took it, and went to
watch. He placed his gun across his knees and sat down. He sat and sat, but nothing
came, nothing came; he got drowsy, was nodding off, when his gun fell off his
knees, and he awoke with a start and watched more warily. At last he heard
something––and there stood the hog. It began to dig up another tree, when he
pulled the trigger and––bang! His brothers heard the sound, came running up,
were quite amazed to see a dead boar lying there, and said, “What will become
of us now?”––“Let us kill him,” said the eldest brother, “and bury him in that
ditch, and say that we killed the hog.” So they took and slew him, and buried
him in the ditch, and took the hog to their father, and said, “While we were
watching, this hog came up and began digging, so we killed him and have brought
him to you.”</span></p>

day a nobleman came by that way, and was surprised to see a beautiful
elder-bush growing out of the ditch; so he went up to it, cut off a branch,
made him a flute out of it, and began playing upon it. But the flute played of
its own accord, and made this moan:</span></p>

nobleman then went on to the inn, and there he found the fool’s father. “Such a
funny thing has happened to me,” said the nobleman. “I went and cut me out a
flute from an elder-bush, and lo! it plays of its own accord!” Then the father
took the flute and tried his hand at it, and it sang:</span></p>
