<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi
and the coyote</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Afar off upon a large level land, a summer sun
was shining bright. Here and there over the rolling green were tall bunches of
coarse gray weeds. Iktomi in his fringed buckskins walked alone across the
prairie with a black bare head glossy in the sunlight. He walked through the
grass without following any well-worn footpath. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From one large bunch of coarse weeds to another
he wound his way about the great plain. He lifted his foot lightly and placed
it gently forward like a wildcat prowling noiselessly through the thick grass.
He stopped a few steps away from a very large bunch of wild sage. From shoulder
to shoulder he tilted his head. Still farther he bent from side to side, first
low over one hip and then over the other. Far forward he stooped, stretching
his long thin neck like a duck, to see what lay under a fur coat beyond the
bunch of coarse grass. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A sleek gray-faced prairie wolf! his pointed
black nose tucked in between his four feet drawn snugly together; his handsome
bushy tail wound over his nose and feet; a coyote fast asleep in the shadow of
a bunch of grass!—this is what Iktomi spied. Carefully he raised one foot and
cautiously reached out with his toes. Gently, gently he lifted the foot behind
and placed it before the other. Thus he came nearer and nearer to the round fur
ball lying motionless under the sage grass. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now Iktomi stood beside it, looking at the
closed eyelids that did not quiver the least bit. Pressing his lips into
straight lines and nodding his head slowly, he bent over the wolf. He held his
ear close to the coyote's nose, but not a breath of air stirred from it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Dead!&quot; said he at last. &quot;Dead,
but not long since he ran over these plains! See! there in his paw is caught a
fresh feather. He is nice fat meat!&quot; Taking hold of the paw with the bird
feather fast on it, he exclaimed, &quot;Why, he is still warm! I'll carry him
to my dwelling and have a roast for my evening meal. Ah-ha!&quot; he laughed,
as he seized the coyote by its two fore paws and its two hind feet and swung
him over head across his shoulders. The wolf was large and the teepee was far
across the prairie. Iktomi trudged along with his burden, smacking his hungry
lips together. He blinked his eyes hard to keep out the salty perspiration
streaming down his face. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All the while the coyote on his back lay gazing
into the sky with wide open eyes. His long white teeth fairly gleamed as he
smiled and smiled. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To ride on one's own feet is tiresome, but
to be carried like a warrior from a brave fight is great fun!&quot; said the
coyote in his heart. He had never been borne on any one's back before and the
new experience delighted him. He lay there lazily on Iktomi's shoulders, now
and then blinking blue winks. Did you never see a birdie blink a blue wink?
This is how it first became a saying among the plains people. When a bird
stands aloof watching your strange ways, a thin bluish white tissue slips
quickly over his eyes and as quickly off again; so quick that you think it was
only a mysterious blue wink. Sometimes when children grow drowsy they blink
blue winks, while others who are too proud to look with friendly eyes upon
people blink in this cold bird-manner. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The coyote was affected by both sleepiness and
pride. His winks were almost as blue as the sky. In the midst of his new
pleasure the swaying motion ceased. Iktomi had reached his dwelling place. The
coyote felt drowsy no longer, for in the next instant he was slipping out of
Iktomi's hands. He was falling, falling through space, and then he struck the
ground with such a bump he did not wish to breathe for a while. He wondered
what Iktomi would do, thus he lay still where he fell. Humming a dance-song,
one from his bundle of mystery songs, Iktomi hopped and darted about at an
imaginary dance and feast. He gathered dry willow sticks and broke them in two
against his knee. He built a large fire out of doors. The flames leaped up high
in red and yellow streaks. Now Iktomi returned to the coyote who had been looking
on through his eyelashes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Taking him again by his paws and hind feet, he
swung him to and fro. Then as the wolf swung toward the red flames, Iktomi let
him go. Once again the coyote fell through space. Hot air smote his nostrils.
He saw red dancing fire, and now he struck a bed of cracking embers. With a
quick turn he leaped out of the flames. From his heels were scattered a shower
of red coals upon Iktomi's bare arms and shoulders. Dumbfounded, Iktomi thought
he saw a spirit walk out of his fire. His jaws fell apart. He thrust a palm to
his face, hard over his mouth! He could scarce keep from shrieking. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rolling over and over on the grass and rubbing
the sides of his head against the ground, the coyote soon put out the fire on
his fur. Iktomi's eyes were almost ready to jump out of his head as he stood
cooling a burn on his brown arm with his breath. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sitting on his haunches, on the opposite side of
the fire from where Iktomi stood, the coyote began to laugh at him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Another day, my friend, do not take too
much for granted. Make sure the enemy is stone dead before you make a
fire!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then off he ran so swiftly that his long bushy
tail hung out in a straight line with his back.</span></p>
