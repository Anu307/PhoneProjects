<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Dance
in a buffalo skull</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was night upon the prairie. Overhead the
stars were twinkling bright their red and yellow lights. The moon was young. A
silvery thread among the stars, it soon drifted low beneath the horizon. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Upon the ground the land was pitchy black. There
are night people on the plain who love the dark. Amid the black level land they
meet to frolic under the stars. Then when their sharp ears hear any strange
footfalls nigh they scamper away into the deep shadows of night. There they are
safely hid from all dangers, they think. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus it was that one very black night, afar off
from the edge of the level land, out of the wooded river bottom glided forth
two balls of fire. They came farther and farther into the level land. They grew
larger and brighter. The dark hid the body of the creature with those fiery
eyes. They came on and on, just over the tops of the prairie grass. It might
have been a wildcat prowling low on soft, stealthy feet. Slowly but surely the
terrible eyes drew nearer and nearer to the heart of the level land. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There in a huge old buffalo skull was a gay
feast and dance! Tiny little field mice were singing and dancing in a circle to
the boom-boom of a wee, wee drum. They were laughing and talking among
themselves while their chosen singers sang loud a merry tune. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They built a small open fire within the center
of their queer dance house. The light streamed out of the buffalo skull through
all the curious sockets and holes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A light on the plain in the middle of the night
was an unusual thing. But so merry were the mice they did not hear the
&quot;king, king&quot; of sleepy birds, disturbed by the unaccustomed fire. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A pack of wolves, fearing to come nigh this
night fire, stood together a little distance away, and, turning their pointed
noses to the stars, howled and yelped most dismally. Even the cry of the wolves
was unheeded by the mice within the lighted buffalo skull. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They were feasting and dancing; they were
singing and laughing—those funny little furry fellows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All the while across the dark from out the low
river bottom came that pair of fiery eyes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now closer and more swift, now fiercer and
glaring, the eyes moved toward the buffalo skull. All unconscious of those
fearful eyes, the happy mice nibbled at dried roots and venison. The singers
had started another song. The drummers beat the time, turning their heads from
side to side in rhythm. In a ring around the fire hopped the mice, each
bouncing hard on his two hind feet. Some carried their tails over their arms,
while others trailed them proudly along. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ah, very near are those round yellow eyes! Very
low to the ground they seem to creep—creep toward the buffalo skull. All of a
sudden they slide into the eye-sockets of the old skull. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Spirit of the buffalo!&quot; squeaked a
frightened mouse as he jumped out from a hole in the back part of the skull. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A cat! a cat!&quot; cried other mice as
they scrambled out of holes both large and snug. Noiseless they ran away into
the dark. </span></p>
