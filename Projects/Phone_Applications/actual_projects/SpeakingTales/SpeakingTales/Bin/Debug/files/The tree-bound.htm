<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The
tree-bound</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was a clear summer day. The blue, blue sky
dropped low over the edge of the green level land. A large yellow sun hung
directly overhead. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The singing of birds filled the summer space
between earth and sky with sweet music. Again and again sang a yellow-breasted
birdie—&quot;Koda Ni Dakota!&quot; He insisted upon it. &quot;Koda Ni
Dakota!&quot; which was &quot;Friend, you're a Dakota! Friend, you're a
Dakota!&quot; Perchance the birdie meant the avenger with the magic arrow, for
there across the plain he strode. He was handsome in his paint and feathers,
proud with his great buckskin quiver on his back and a long bow in his hand.
Afar to an eastern camp of cone-shaped teepees he was going. There over the
Indian village hovered a large red eagle threatening the safety of the people.
Every morning rose this terrible red bird out of a high chalk bluff and
spreading out his gigantic wings soared slowly over the round camp ground. Then
it was that the people, terror-stricken, ran screaming into their lodges.
Covering their heads with their blankets, they sat trembling with fear. No one
dared to venture out till the red eagle had disappeared beyond the west, where
meet the blue and green. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In vain tried the chieftain of the tribe to find
among his warriors a powerful marksman who could send a death arrow to the
man-hungry bird. At last to urge his men to their utmost skill he bade his
crier proclaim a new reward. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Of the chieftain's two beautiful daughters he
would have his choice who brought the dreaded red eagle with an arrow in its
breast. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Upon hearing these words, the men of the
village, both young and old, both heroes and cowards, trimmed new arrows for
the contest. At gray dawn there stood indistinct under the shadow of the bluff
many human figures; silent as ghosts and wrapped in robes girdled tight about
their waists, they waited with chosen bow and arrow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some cunning old warriors stayed not with the
group. They crouched low upon the open ground. But all eyes alike were fixed
upon the top of the high bluff. Breathless they watched for the soaring of the
red eagle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From within the dwellings many eyes peeped
through the small holes in the front lapels of the teepee. With shaking knees
and hard-set teeth, the women peered out upon the Dakota men prowling about
with bows and arrows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length when the morning sun also peeped over
the eastern horizon at the armed Dakotas, the red eagle walked out upon the
edge of the cliff. Pluming his gorgeous feathers, he ruffled his neck and
flapped his strong wings together. Then he dived into the air. Slowly he winged
his way over the round camp ground; over the men with their strong bows and
arrows! In an instant the long bows were bent. Strong straight arrows with red
feathered tips sped upward to the blue sky. Ah! slowly moved those indifferent
wings, untouched by the poison-beaked arrows. Off to the west beyond the reach
of arrow, beyond the reach of eye, the red eagle flew away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A sudden clamor of high-pitched voices broke the
deadly stillness of the dawn. The women talked excitedly about the invulnerable
red of the eagle's feathers, while the would-be heroes sulked within their
wigwams. &quot;He-he-he!&quot; groaned the chieftain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the evening of the same day sat a group of
hunters around a bright burning fire. They were talking of a strange young man
whom they spied while out upon a hunt for deer beyond the bluffs. They saw the
stranger taking aim. Following the point of his arrow with their eyes, they
beheld a herd of buffalo. The arrow sprang from the bow! It darted into the
skull of the foremost buffalo. But unlike other arrows it pierced through the
head of the creature and spinning in the air lit into the next buffalo head.
One by one the buffalo fell upon the sweet grass they were grazing. With
straight quivering limbs they lay on their sides. The young man stood calmly
by, counting on his fingers the buffalo as they dropped dead to the ground.
When the last one fell, he ran thither and picking up his magic arrow wiped it
carefully on the soft grass. He slipped it into his long fringed quiver. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He is going to make a feast for some
hungry tribe of men or beasts!&quot; cried the hunters among themselves as they
hastened away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They were afraid of the stranger with the sacred
arrow. When the hunter's tale of the stranger's arrow reached the ears of the
chieftain, his face brightened with a smile. He sent forth fleet horsemen, to
learn of him his birth, his name, and his deeds. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If he is the avenger with the magic arrow,
sprung up from the earth out of a clot of buffalo blood, bid him come hither.
Let him kill the red eagle with his magic arrow. Let him win for himself one of
my beautiful daughters,&quot; he had said to his messengers, for the old story
of the badger's man-son was known all over the level lands. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After four days and nights the braves returned.
&quot;He is coming,&quot; they said. &quot;We have seen him. He is straight and
tall; handsome in face, with large black eyes. He paints his round cheeks with
bright red, and wears the penciled lines of red over his temples like our men
of honored rank. He carries on his back a long fringed quiver in which he keeps
his magic arrow. His bow is long and strong. He is coming now to kill the big
red eagle.&quot; All around the camp ground from mouth to ear passed those
words of the returned messengers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it chanced that immortal Iktomi, fully
recovered from the brown burnt spots, overheard the people talking. At once he
was filled with a new desire. &quot;If only I had the magic arrow, I would kill
the red eagle and win the chieftain's daughter for a wife,&quot; said he in his
heart. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Back to his lonely wigwam he hastened. Beneath
the tree in front of his teepee he sat upon the ground with chin between his
drawn-up knees. His keen eyes scanned the wide plain. He was watching for the
avenger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;'He is coming!' said the people,&quot;
muttered old Iktomi. All of a sudden he raised an open palm to his brow and
peered afar into the west. The summer sun hung bright in the middle of a
cloudless sky. There across the green prairie was a man walking bareheaded
toward the east. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ha! ha! 'tis he! the man with the magic
arrow!&quot; laughed Iktomi. And when the bird with the yellow breast sang loud
again—&quot;Koda Ni Dakota! Friend, you're a Dakota!&quot; Iktomi put his hand
over his mouth as he threw his head far backward, laughing at both the bird and
man. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He is your friend, but his arrow will kill
one of your kind! He is a Dakota, but soon he'll grow into the bark on this
tree! Ha! ha! ha!&quot; he laughed again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young avenger walked with swaying strides
nearer and nearer toward the lonely wigwam and tree. Iktomi heard the swish!
swish! of the stranger's feet through the tall grass. He was passing now beyond
the tree, when Iktomi, springing to his feet, called out: &quot;How, how, my
friend! I see you are dressed in handsome deerskins and have red paint on your
cheeks. You are going to some feast or dance, may I ask?&quot; Seeing the young
man only smiled Iktomi went on: &quot;I have not had a mouthful of food this
day. Have pity on me, young brave, and shoot yonder bird for me!&quot; With
these words Iktomi pointed toward the tree-top, where sat a bird on the highest
branch. The young avenger, always ready to help those in distress, sent an
arrow upward and the bird fell. In the next branch it was caught between the
forked prongs. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friend, climb the tree and get the
bird. I cannot climb so high. I would get dizzy and fall,&quot; pleaded Iktomi.
The avenger began to scale the tree, when Iktomi cried to him: &quot;My friend,
your beaded buckskins may be torn by the branches. Leave them safe upon the
grass till you are down again.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are right,&quot; replied the young
man, quickly slipping off his long fringed quiver. Together with his dangling
pouches and tinkling ornaments, he placed it on the ground. Now he climbed the
tree unhindered. Soon from the top he took the bird. &quot;My friend, toss to
me your arrow that I may have the honor of wiping it clean on soft
deerskin!&quot; exclaimed Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How!&quot; said the brave, and threw the
bird and arrow to the ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At once Iktomi seized the arrow. Rubbing it
first on the grass and then on a piece of deerskin, he muttered indistinct
words all the while. The young man, stepping downward from limb to limb,
hearing the low muttering, said: &quot;Iktomi, I cannot hear what you
say!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, my friend, I was only talking of your
big heart.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Again stooping over the arrow Iktomi continued
his repetition of charm words. &quot;Grow fast, grow fast to the bark of the
tree,&quot; he whispered. Still the young man moved slowly downward. Suddenly
dropping the arrow and standing erect, Iktomi said aloud: &quot;Grow fast to
the bark of the tree!&quot; Before the brave could leap from the tree he became
tight-grown to the bark. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah! ha!&quot; laughed the bad Iktomi.
&quot;I have the magic arrow! I have the beaded buckskins of the great
avenger!&quot; Hooting and dancing beneath the tree, he said: &quot;I shall
kill the red eagle; I shall wed the chieftain's beautiful daughter!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, Iktomi, set me free!&quot; begged the
tree-bound Dakota brave. But Iktomi's ears were like the fungus on a tree. He
did not hear with them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Wearing the handsome buckskins and carrying
proudly the magic arrow in his right hand, he started off eastward. Imitating
the swaying strides of the avenger, he walked away with a face turned slightly
skyward. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, set me free! I am glued to the tree
like its own bark! Cut me loose!&quot; moaned the prisoner. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A young woman, carrying on her strong back a
bundle of tightly bound willow sticks, passed near by the lonely teepee. She
heard the wailing man's voice. She paused to listen to the sad words. Looking
around she saw nowhere a human creature. &quot;It may be a spirit,&quot;
thought she. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! cut me loose! set me free! Iktomi has
played me false! He has made me bark of his tree!&quot; cried the voice again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young woman dropped her pack of firewood to
the ground. With her stone axe she hurried to the tree. There before her
astonished eyes clung a young brave close to the tree. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Too shy for words, yet too kind-hearted to leave
the stranger tree-bound, she cut loose the whole bark. Like an open jacket she
drew it to the ground. With it came the young man also. Free once more, he
started away. Looking backward, a few paces from the young woman, he waved his
hand, upward and downward, before her face. This was a sign of gratitude used
when words failed to interpret strong emotion. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the bewildered woman reached her dwelling,
she mounted a pony and rode swiftly across the rolling land. To the camp ground
in the east, to the chieftain troubled by the red eagle, she carried her story.
