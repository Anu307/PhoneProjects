<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Husband and the
Parrot</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A good man had a beautiful wife, whom he loved
passionately, and never left if possible. One day, when he was obliged by
important business to go away from her, he went to a place where all kinds of
birds are sold and bought a parrot. This parrot not only spoke well, but it had
the gift of telling all that had been done before it. He brought it home in a
cage, and asked his wife to put it in her room, and take great care of it while
he was away. Then he departed. On his return he asked the parrot what had
happened during his absence, and the parrot told him some things which made him
scold his wife. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She thought that one of her slaves must have
been telling tales of her, but they told her it was the parrot, and she
resolved to revenge herself on him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When her husband next went away for one day, she
told on slave to turn under the bird's cage a hand-mill; another to throw water
down from above the cage, and a third to take a mirror and turn it in front of
its eyes, from left to right by the light of a candle. The slaves did this for
part of the night, and did it very well. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day when the husband came back he asked
the parrot what he had seen. The bird replied, &quot;My good master, the lightning,
thunder and rain disturbed me so much all night long, that I cannot tell you
what I have suffered.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The husband, who knew that it had neither rained
nor thundered in the night, was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the
truth, so he took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on the ground
that he killed him. Nevertheless he was sorry afterwards, for he found that the
parrot had spoken the truth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When the Greek king,&quot; said the
fisherman to the genius, &quot;had finished the story of the parrot, he added
to the vizir, &quot;And so, vizir, I shall not listen to you, and I shall take
care of the physician, in case I repent as the husband did when he had killed
the parrot.&quot; But the vizir was determined. &quot;Sire,&quot; he replied, &quot;the
death of the parrot was nothing. But when it is a question of the life of a
king it is better to sacrifice the innocent than save the guilty. It is no
uncertain thing, however. The physician, Douban, wishes to assassinate you. My
zeal prompts me to disclose this to your Majesty. If I am wrong, I deserve to
be punished as a vizir was once punished.&quot; &quot;What had the vizir
done,&quot; said the Greek king, &quot;to merit the punishment?&quot; &quot;I
will tell your Majesty, if you will do me the honour to listen,&quot; answered
the vizir.&quot;</span></p>
