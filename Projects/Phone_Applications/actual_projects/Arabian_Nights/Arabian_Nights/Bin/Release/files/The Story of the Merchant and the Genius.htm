<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Merchant and the
Genius</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sire, there was once upon a time a merchant who
possessed great wealth, in land and merchandise, as well as in ready money. He
was obliged from time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs. One day,
having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse, taking with him a
small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits and dates, because he had to
pass through the desert where no food was to be got. He arrived without any
mishap, and, having finished his business, set out on his return. On the fourth
day of his journey, the heat of the sun being very great, he turned out of his
road to rest under some trees. He found at the foot of a large walnut-tree a
fountain of clear and running water. He dismounted, fastened his horse to a
branch of the tree, and sat by the fountain, after having taken from his wallet
some of his dates and biscuits. When he had finished this frugal meal he washed
his face and hands in the fountain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he was thus employed he saw an enormous
genius, white with rage, coming towards him, with a scimitar in his hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Arise,&quot; he cried in a terrible voice,
&quot;and let me kill you as you have killed my son!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he uttered these words he gave a frightful
yell. The merchant, quite as much terrified at the hideous face of the monster
as at his words, answered him tremblingly, &quot;Alas, good sir, what can I
have done to you to deserve death?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I shall kill you,&quot; repeated the
genius, &quot;as you have killed my son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; said the merchant, &quot;how
can I have killed your son? I do not know him, and I have never even seen
him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When you arrived here did you not sit down
on the ground?&quot; asked the genius, &quot;and did you not take some dates
from your wallet, and whilst eating them did not you throw the stones
about?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the merchant, &quot;I
certainly did so.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then,&quot; said the genius, &quot;I tell
you you have killed my son, for whilst you were throwing about the stones, my
son passed by, and one of them struck him in the eye and killed him. So I shall
kill you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah, sir, forgive me!&quot; cried the
merchant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will have no mercy on you,&quot;
answered the genius. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But I killed your son quite
unintentionally, so I implore you to spare my life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No,&quot; said the genius, &quot;I shall
kill you as you killed my son,&quot; and so saying, he seized the merchant by
the arm, threw him on the ground, and lifted his sabre to cut off his head. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, protesting his innocence, bewailed
his wife and children, and tried pitifully to avert his fate. The genius, with
his raised scimitar, waited till he had finished, but was not in the least
touched. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scheherazade, at this point, seeing that it was
day, and knowing that the Sultan always rose very early to attend the council,
stopped speaking. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Indeed, sister,&quot; said Dinarzade,
&quot;this is a wonderful story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The rest is still more wonderful,&quot;
replied Scheherazade, &quot;and you would say so, if the sultan would allow me
to live another day, and would give me leave to tell it to you the next
night.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Schahriar, who had been listening to
Scheherazade with pleasure, said to himself, &quot;I will wait till to-morrow;
I can always have her killed when I have heard the end of her story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All this time the grand-vizir was in a terrible
state of anxiety. But he was much delighted when he saw the Sultan enter the
council-chamber without giving the terrible command that he was expecting. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning, before the day broke,
Dinarzade said to her sister, &quot;Dear sister, if you are awake I pray you to
go on with your story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan did not wait for Scheherazade to ask
his leave. &quot;Finish,&quot; said he, &quot;the story of the genius and the
merchant. I am curious to hear the end.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So Scheherazade went on with the story. This
happened every morning. The Sultana told a story, and the Sultan let her live
to finish it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the merchant saw that the genius was
determined to cut off his head, he said: &quot;One word more, I entreat you.
Grant me a little delay; just a short time to go home and bid my wife and
children farewell, and to make my will. When I have done this I will come back
here, and you shall kill me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; said the genius, &quot;if I
grant you the delay you ask, I am afraid that you will not come back.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I give you my word of honour,&quot;
answered the merchant, &quot;that I will come back without fail.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How long do you require?&quot; asked the
genius. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I ask you for a year's grace,&quot;
replied the merchant. &quot;I promise you that to-morrow twelvemonth, I shall
be waiting under these trees to give myself up to you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On this the genius left him near the fountain
and disappeared. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, having recovered from his fright,
mounted his horse and went on his road. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he arrived home his wife and children
received him with the greatest joy. But instead of embracing them he began to
weep so bitterly that they soon guessed that something terrible was the matter.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell us, I pray you,&quot; said his wife,
&quot;what has happened.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot; answered her husband, &quot;I
have only a year to live.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he told them what had passed between him
and the genius, and how he had given his word to return at the end of a year to
be killed. When they heard this sad news they were in despair, and wept much. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day the merchant began to settle his
affairs, and first of all to pay his debts. He gave presents to his friends,
and large alms to the poor. He set his slaves at liberty, and provided for his
wife and children. The year soon passed away, and he was obliged to depart.
When he tried to say good-bye he was quite overcome with grief, and with
difficulty tore himself away. At length he reached the place where he had first
seen the genius, on the very day that he had appointed. He dismounted, and sat
down at the edge of the fountain, where he awaited the genius in terrible
suspense. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst he was thus waiting an old man leading a
hind came towards him. They greeted one another, and then the old man said to
him, &quot;May I ask, brother, what brought you to this desert place, where
there are so many evil genii about? To see these beautiful trees one would
imagine it was inhabited, but it is a dangerous place to stop long in.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant told the old man why he was obliged
to come there. He listened in astonishment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is a most marvellous affair. I should
like to be a witness of your interview with the genius.&quot; So saying he sat
down by the merchant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While they were talking another old man came up,
followed by two black dogs. He greeted them, and asked what they were doing in
this place. The old man who was leading the hind told him the adventure of the
merchant and the genius. The second old man had not sooner heard the story than
he, too, decided to stay there to see what would happen. He sat down by the
others, and was talking, when a third old man arrived. He asked why the
merchant who was with them looked so sad. They told him the story, and he also
resolved to see what would pass between the genius and the merchant, so waited
with the rest. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They soon saw in the distance a thick smoke,
like a cloud of dust. This smoke came nearer and nearer, and then, all at once,
it vanished, and they saw the genius, who, without speaking to them, approached
the merchant, sword in hand, and, taking him by the arm, said, &quot;Get up and
let me kill you as you killed my son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant and the three old men began to weep
and groan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the old man leading the hind threw himself
at the monster's feet and said, &quot;O Prince of the Genii, I beg of you to
stay your fury and to listen to me. I am going to tell you my story and that of
the hind I have with me, and if you find it more marvellous than that of the
merchant whom you are about to kill, I hope that you will do away with a third
part of his punishment?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The genius considered some time, and then he
said, &quot;Very well, I agree to this.&quot; </span></p>
