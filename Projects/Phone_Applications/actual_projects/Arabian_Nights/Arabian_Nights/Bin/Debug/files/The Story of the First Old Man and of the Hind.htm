<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the First Old Man and of
the Hind</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I am now going to begin my story (said the old
man), so please attend. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This hind that you see with me is my wife. We
have no children of our own, therefore I adopted the son of a favorite slave,
and determined to make him my heir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My wife, however, took a great dislike to both
mother and child, which she concealed from me till too late. When my adopted
son was about ten years old I was obliged to go on a journey. Before I went I
entrusted to my wife's keeping both the mother and child, and begged her to
take care of them during my absence, which lasted a whole year. During this
time she studied magic in order to carry out her wicked scheme. When she had
learnt enough she took my son into a distant place and changed him into a calf.
Then she gave him to my steward, and told him to look after a calf she had
bought. She also changed the slave into a cow, which she sent to my steward. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I returned I inquired after my slave and
the child. &quot;Your slave is dead,&quot; she said, &quot;and as for your son,
I have not seen him for two months, and I do not know where he is.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was grieved to hear of my slave's death, but
as my son had only disappeared, I thought I should soon find him. Eight months,
however, passed, and still no tidings of him; then the feast of Bairam came. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To celebrate it I ordered my steward to bring me
a very fat cow to sacrifice. He did so. The cow that he brought was my
unfortunate slave. I bound her, but just as I was about to kill her she began
to low most piteously, and I saw that her eyes were streaming with tears. It
seemed to me most extraordinary, and, feeling a movement of pity, I ordered the
steward to lead her away and bring another. My wife, who was present, scoffed
at my compassion, which made her malice of no avail. &quot;What are you
doing?&quot; she cried. &quot;Kill this cow. It is the best we have to
sacrifice.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To please her, I tried again, but again the
animal's lows and tears disarmed me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take her away,&quot; I said to the
steward, &quot;and kill her; I cannot.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The steward killed her, but on skinning her
found that she was nothing but bones, although she appeared so fat. I was
vexed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Keep her for yourself,&quot; I said to the
steward, &quot;and if you have a fat calf, bring that in her stead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In a short time he brought a very fat calf,
which, although I did not know it, was my son. It tried hard to break its cord
and come to me. It threw itself at my feet, with its head on the ground, as if
it wished to excite my pity, and to beg me not to take away its life. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was even more surprised and touched at this
action than I had been at the tears of the cow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go,&quot; I said to the steward,
&quot;take back this calf, take great care of it, and bring me another in its
place instantly.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as my wife heard me speak this she at
once cried out, &quot;What are you doing, husband? Do not sacrifice any calf
but this.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wife,&quot; I answered, &quot;I will not
sacrifice this calf,&quot; and in spite of all her remonstrances, I remained
firm. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had another calf killed; this one was led
away. The next day the steward asked to speak to me in private. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have come,&quot; he said, &quot;to tell
you some news which I think you will like to hear. I have a daughter who knows
magic. Yesterday, when I was leading back the calf which you refused to
sacrifice, I noticed that she smiled, and then directly afterwards began to
cry. I asked her why she did so.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Father,&quot; she answered, &quot;this
calf is the son of our master. I smile with joy at seeing him still alive, and
I weep to think of his mother, who was sacrificed yesterday as a cow. These
changes have been wrought by our master's wife, who hated the mother and
son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;At these words, of Genius,&quot; continued
the old man, &quot;I leave you to imagine my astonishment. I went immediately
with the steward to speak with his daughter myself. First of all I went to the
stable to see my son, and he replied in his dumb way to all my caresses. When
the steward's daughter came I asked her if she could change my son back to his
proper shape.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, I can,&quot; she replied, &quot;on
two conditions. One is that you will give him to me for a husband, and the
other is that you will let me punish the woman who changed him into a
calf.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To the first condition,&quot; I answered,
&quot;I agree with all my heart, and I will give you an ample dowry. To the
second I also agree, I only beg you to spare her life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That I will do,&quot; she replied; &quot;I
will treat her as she treated your son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then she took a vessel of water and pronounced
over it some words I did not understand; then, on throwing the water over him,
he became immediately a young man once more. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son, my dear son,&quot; I exclaimed,
kissing him in a transport of joy. &quot;This kind maiden has rescued you from
a terrible enchantment, and I am sure that out of gratitude you will marry
her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He consented joyfully, but before they were
married, the young girl changed my wife into a hind, and it is she whom you see
before you. I wished her to have this form rather than a stranger one, so that
we could see her in the family without repugnance. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Since then my son has become a widower and has
gone travelling. I am now going in search of him, and not wishing to confide my
wife to the care of other people, I am taking her with me. Is this not a most
marvellous tale? </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is indeed,&quot; said the genius,
&quot;and because of it I grant to you the third part of the punishment of this
merchant.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the first old man had finished his story,
the second, who was leading the two black dogs, said to the genius, &quot;I am
going to tell you what happened to me, and I am sure that you will find my
story even more astonishing than the one to which you have just been listening.
But when I have related it, will you grant me also the third part of the
merchant's punishment?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the genius,
&quot;provided that your story surpasses that of the hind.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With this agreement the second old man began in
this way. </span></p>
