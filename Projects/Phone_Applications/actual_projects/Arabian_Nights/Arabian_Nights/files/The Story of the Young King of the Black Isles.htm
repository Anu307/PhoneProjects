<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Young King of the
Black Isles</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>You must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud,
the king of this country, the Black Isles, so called from the four little
mountains which were once islands, while the capital was the place where now
the great lake lies. My story will tell you how these changes came about. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My father died when he was sixty-six, and I
succeeded him. I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she
loved me too. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and
was being fanned by two of her maids, I heard one say to the other, &quot;What
a pity it is that our mistress no longer loves our master! I believe she would
like to kill him if she could, for she is an enchantress.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I soon found by watching that they were right,
and when I mortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime, she
begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where she wept and bewailed
him for two years. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last I begged her to cease grieving for him,
for although he could not speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him
alive. She turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic words, and I
instantly became as you see me now, half man and half marble. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then this wicked enchantress changed the
capital, which was a very populous and flourishing city, into the lake and
desert plain you saw. The fish of four colours which are in it are the
different races who lived in the town; the four hills are the four islands
which give the name to my kingdom. All this the enchantress told me to add to
my troubles. And this is not all. Every day she comes and beats me with a whip
of buffalo hide. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the young king had finished his sad story
he burst once more into tears, and the Sultan was much moved. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell me,&quot; he cried, &quot;where is
this wicked woman, and where is the miserable object of her affection, whom she
just manages to keep alive?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Where she lives I do not know,&quot;
answered the unhappy prince, &quot;but she goes every day at sunrise to see if
the slave can yet speak to her, after she has beaten me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Unfortunate king,&quot; said the Sultan,
&quot;I will do what I can to avenge you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he consulted with the young king over the
best way to bring this about, and they agreed their plan should be put in
effect the next day. The Sultan then rested, and the young king gave himself up
to happy hopes of release. The next day the Sultan arose, and then went to the
palace in the garden where the black slave was. He drew his sword and destroyed
the little life that remained in him, and then threw the body down a well. He
then lay down on the couch where the slave had been, and waited for the
enchantress. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She went first to the young king, whom she beat
with a hundred blows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then she came to the room where she thought her
wounded slave was, but where the Sultan really lay. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She came near his couch and said, &quot;Are you
better to-day, my dear slave? Speak but one word to me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How can I be better,&quot; answered the
Sultan, imitating the language of the Ethiopians, &quot;when I can never sleep
for the cries and groans of your husband?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What joy to hear you speak!&quot; answered
the queen. &quot;Do you wish him to regain his proper shape?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Sultan; &quot;hasten
to set him at liberty, so that I may no longer hear his cries.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The queen at once went out and took a cup of
water, and said over it some words that made it boil as if it were on the fire.
Then she threw it over the prince, who at once regained his own form. He was
filled with joy, but the enchantress said, &quot;Hasten away from this place
and never come back, lest I kill you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he hid himself to see the end of the Sultan's
plan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The enchantress went back to the Palace of Tears
and said, &quot;Now I have done what you wished.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What you have done,&quot; said the Sultan,
&quot;is not enough to cure me. Every day at midnight all the people whom you
have changed into fish lift their heads out of the lake and cry for vengeance.
Go quickly, and give them their proper shape.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The enchantress hurried away and said some words
over the lake. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fish then became men, women, and children,
and the houses and shops were once more filled. The Sultan's suite, who had
encamped by the lake, were not a little astonished to see themselves in the
middle of a large and beautiful town. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as she had disenchanted it the queen
went back to the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Are you quite well now?&quot; she said. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Come near,&quot; said the Sultan.
&quot;Nearer still.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She obeyed. Then he sprang up, and with one blow
of his sword he cut her in two. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he went and found the prince. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Rejoice,&quot; he said, &quot;your cruel
enemy is dead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince thanked him again and again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And now,&quot; said the Sultan. &quot;I
will go back to my capital, which I am glad to find is so near yours.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;So near mine!&quot; said the King of the
Black Isles. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you know it is a whole year's journey
from here? You came here in a few hours because it was enchanted. But I will
accompany you on your journey.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It will give me much pleasure if you will
escort me,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;and as I have no children, I will make
you my heir.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan and the prince set out together, the
Sultan laden with rich presents from the King of the Black Isles. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The day after he reached his capital the Sultan
assembled his court and told them all that had befallen him, and told them how
he intended to adopt the young king as his heir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he gave each man presents in proportion to
his rank. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As for the fisherman, as he was the first cause
of the deliverance of the young prince, the Sultan gave him much money, and
made him and his family happy for the rest of their days. </span></p>
