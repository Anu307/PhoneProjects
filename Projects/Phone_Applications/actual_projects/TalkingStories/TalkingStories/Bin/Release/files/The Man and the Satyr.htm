<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Man had lost his way in a wood one bitter
winter's night. As he was roaming about, a Satyr came up to him, and finding
that he had lost his way, promised to give him a lodging for the night, and
guide him out of the forest in the morning. As he went along to the Satyr's
cell, the Man raised both his hands to his mouth and kept on blowing at them.
&quot;What do you do that for?&quot; said the Satyr. &quot;My hands are numb
with the cold,&quot; said the Man, &quot;and my breath warms them.&quot; After
this they arrived at the Satyr's home, and soon the Satyr put a smoking dish of
porridge before him. But when the Man raised his spoon to his mouth he began
blowing upon it. &quot;And what do you do that for?&quot; said the Satyr.
&quot;The porridge is too hot, and my breath will cool it.&quot; &quot;Out you
go,&quot; said the Satyr. &quot;I will have nought to do with a man who can
blow hot and cold with the same breath.&quot;</span></p>
