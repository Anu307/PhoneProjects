font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh Father,&quot; said a little Frog to the
big one sitting by the side of a pool, &quot;I have seen such a terrible
monster! It was as big as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail,
and it had hoofs divided in two.&quot; &quot;Tush, child, tush,&quot; said the
old Frog, &quot;that was only Farmer White's Ox. It isn't so big either; he may
be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad;
just you see.&quot; So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew
himself out. &quot;Was he as big as that?&quot; asked he. &quot;Oh, much bigger
than that,&quot; said the young Frog. Again the old one blew himself out, and
asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that. &quot;Bigger, father,
bigger,&quot; was the reply. So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew
and blew, and swelled and swelled and swelled. And then he said: &quot;I'm sure
the Ox is not as big asBut at this moment he burst. Self-conceit may lead to
self-destruction.</span></p>
