<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Two Fellows were travelling together through a
wood, when a Bear rushed out upon them. One of the travellers happened to be in
front, and he seized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid himself among the
leaves. The other, seeing no help for it, threw himself flat down upon the
ground, with his face in the dust. The Bear, coming up to him, put his muzzle
close to his ear, and sniffed and sniffed. But at last with a growl he shook
his head and slouched off, for bears will not touch dead meat. Then the fellow
in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said &quot;What was it
that Master Bruin whispered to you?&quot; &quot;He told me,&quot; said the
other, &quot;Never trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch.&quot;</span></p>
