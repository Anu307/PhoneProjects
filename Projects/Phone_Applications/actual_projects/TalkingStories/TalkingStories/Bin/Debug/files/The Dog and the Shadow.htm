<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat
and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace. Now on his way home
he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, he looked
down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath. Thinking it was
another dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have that also.
So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the
piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more. Beware
lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.</span></p>
