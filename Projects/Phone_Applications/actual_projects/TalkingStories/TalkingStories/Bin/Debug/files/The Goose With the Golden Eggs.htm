<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day a countryman going to the nest of his
Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was
as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick
had been played upon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon
found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same
thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich he
grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he
killed it and opened it only to find nothing. Greed oft o'er reaches itself.</span></p>
