<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Man and his son were once going with their
Donkey to market. As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed
them and said: &quot;You fools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?&quot; So
the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they
passed a group of men, one of whom said: &quot;See that lazy youngster, he lets
his father walk while he rides.&quot; So the Man ordered his Boy to get off,
and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of
whom said to the other: &quot;Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little
son trudge along.&quot; Well, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last he
took his Boy up before him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the
town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and
asked what they were scoffing at. The men said: &quot;Aren't you ashamed of
yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yoursu and your hulking son?&quot;
The Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they
thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and
raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the
laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey,
getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of
the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet
being tied together he was drowned. &quot;That will teach you,&quot; said an
old man who had followed them: &quot;Please all, and you will please
none.&quot;</span></p>
