font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden
and proposed marriage to her parents. The old people did not know what to say.
They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to
enrage the King of Beasts. At last the father said: &quot;We feel highly
honoured by your Majesty's proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young
thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly
do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have
your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider
your proposal again.&quot; The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws
trimmed and his big teeth taken out. But when he came again to the parents of
the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst. Love
can tame the wildest.</span></p>
