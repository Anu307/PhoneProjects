<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Frogs were living as happy as could be in a
marshy swamp that just suited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody
and nobody troubling with them. But some of them thought that this was not
right, that they should have a king and a proper constitution, so they
determined to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted.
&quot;Mighty Jove,&quot; they cried, &quot;send unto us a king that will rule
over us and keep us in order.&quot; Jove laughed at their croaking, and threw
down into the swamp a huge Log, which came downrplashto the swamp. The Frogs
were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst, and
all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster; but after a time,
seeing that it did not move, one or two of the boldest of them ventured out
towards the Log, and even dared to touch it; still it did not move. Then the
greatest hero of the Frogs jumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and
down upon it, thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for some time
the Frogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest
notice of their new King Log lying in their midst. But this did not suit them,
so they sent another petition to Jove, and said to him, &quot;We want a real
king; one that will really rule over us.&quot; Now this made Jove angry, so he
sent among them a big Stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up. Then
the Frogs repented when too late. Better no rule than cruel rule.</span></p>
