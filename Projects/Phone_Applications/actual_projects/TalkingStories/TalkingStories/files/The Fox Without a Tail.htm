<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened that a Fox caught its tail in a
trap, and in struggling to release himself lost all of it but the stump. At
first he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes. But at last he
determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes
to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them.
When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away
with their tails. He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were
pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was in the way when they
desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another. He
failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance.
&quot;That is all very well,&quot; said one of the older foxes; &quot;but I do
not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if
you had not happened to lose it yourself.&quot; Distrust interested advice.</span></p>
