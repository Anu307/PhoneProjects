<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Peacock once placed a petition before Juno
desiring to have the voice of a nightingale in addition to his other
attractions; but Juno refused his request. When he persisted, and pointed out
that he was her favourite bird, she said: &quot;Be content with your lot; one
cannot be first in everything.&quot;</span></p>

name=TheFoxandtheLion id=TheFoxandtheLion></a></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly
frightened, and ran away and hid himself in the wood. Next time however he came
near the King of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and watched him pass by.
The third time they came near one another the Fox went straight up to the Lion
and passed the time of day with him, asking him how his family were, and when
he should have the pleasure of seeing him again; then turning his tail, he
parted from the Lion without much ceremony. Familiarity breeds contempt.</span></p>
