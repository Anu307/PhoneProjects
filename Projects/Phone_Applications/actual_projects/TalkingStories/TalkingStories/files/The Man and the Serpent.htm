<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Countryman's son by accident trod upon a
Serpent's tail, which turned and bit him so that he died. The father in a rage
got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail. So the Serpent
in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer's cattle and caused him severe
loss. Well, the Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent, and
brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it: &quot;Let's
forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance
on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that we are
both satisfied why should not we be friends again?&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot;
said the Serpent; &quot;take away your gifts; you can never forget the death of
your son, nor I the loss of my tail.&quot; Injuries may be forgiven, but not
forgotten.</span></p>
