<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the old days, when men were allowed to have
many wives, a middle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young;
each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself. Now the Man's
hair was turning grey, which the young Wife did not like, as it made him look
too old for her husband. So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out
the white ones. But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great
pleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother. So every morning
she used to Arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she
could. The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald. Yield to
all and you will soon have nothing to yield.</span></p>
