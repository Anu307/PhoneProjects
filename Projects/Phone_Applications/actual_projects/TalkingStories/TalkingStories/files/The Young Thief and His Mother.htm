<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A young Man had been caught in a daring act of
theft and had been condemned to be executed for it. He expressed his desire to see
his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of course
this was granted. When his Mother came to him he said: &quot;I want to whisper
to you,&quot; and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off. All
the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal
and inhuman conduct. &quot;It is to punish her,&quot; he said. &quot;When I was
young I began with stealing little things, and brought them home to Mother.
Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and said: &quot;It will not
be noticed.&quot; It is because of her that I am here to-day.&quot; &quot;He is
right, woman,&quot; said the Priest; &quot;the Lord said: &quot;Train up a
child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart therefore.&quot;</span></p>
