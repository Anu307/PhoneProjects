font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Be quiet now,&quot; said an old Nurse to a
child sitting on her lap. &quot;If you make that noise again I will throw you
to the Wolf.&quot; Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the
window as this was said. So he crouched down by the side of the house and
waited. &quot;I am in good luck to-day,&quot; thought he. &quot;It is sure to
cry soon, and a daintier morsel I haven't had for many a long day.&quot; So he
waited, and he waited, and he waited, till at last the child began to cry, and
the Wolf came forward before the window, and looked up to the Nurse, wagging
his tail. But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help,
and the dogs of the house came rushing out. &quot;Ah,&quot; said the Wolf as he
galloped away, &quot;Enemies promises were made to be broken.&quot;</span></p>
