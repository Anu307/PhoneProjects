         Make small lemon size balls out of the dough and keep them covered.
        Dust the working surface with little flour. Take a ball and roll into
        round shape. Smear ghee on the surface. Now fold it into half and again
        half. It should look like a triangle. Then press lightly with the
        rolling pin. Follow the same procedure for the remaining balls. Heat oil
        in a frying pan, dip prepared trianglular puris one by one. Deep fry in
        a medium flame till golden brown. <BR>

        on the plate. Decorate with grated dry coconut (copra) and chopped nuts
        on top of each puri </DIV>
