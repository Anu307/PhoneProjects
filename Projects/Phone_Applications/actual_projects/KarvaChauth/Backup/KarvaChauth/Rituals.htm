        </TABLE>Karva Chauth is one such occasion when most married Hindu women
        in North India seek the blessings of God for their husband's long life.

        quite popular among the newlyweds. A few days before the festival,
        markets are full of items needed for the festival. The preparations for
        this festival start a week in advance. Appointments are made with beauty
        parlours, hands are decorated with intricate mehendi designs and
        jewelery and cloth merchants do a brisk business. <BR>

        Parvati, Ganesh, Kartikeya and the moon. The blessings of the Gods are
        invoked for longevity and prosperity of their husbands and children.
        Mothers-in-law give their daughters-in-law sumptuous food called 'Sargi'
        to eat before sunrise, as the fast starts before sunrise and ends only
        after worshiping the moon at night. It is a tough fast, as the women do
        not take any food or water. <BR>

        goodies from her mother, which is meant for the mother-in-law. The
        basket contains sweets, mathadi, fruits and a sari. Before the sun sets,
        most of the women in a locality gather in one house and prepare a corner
        for the puja. This puja chowk is beautifully decorated and a small
        platform is prepared against a wall. On this, the image of Gauri Mata or
        Goddess Parvati is placed. In the olden days, this image was made of
        cow-dung. <BR>

        places a karva or a pitcher full of water and seven pieces of pua in
        front of her. It is adorned with kharia, aipun and a little roli. A red
        thread is tied around the karva. At the beginning of the puja, women
        apply the roli teeka to Goddess Gauri and also to themselves. With the
        thumb and the third finger of the right hand, water is sprinkled on the
        image of the goddess. The same procedure is repeated with aipun and roli
        . Lastly, rice is showered on the image. <BR>

        Even a widow can narrate this story. The women then pray for the long
        life and welfare of their husbands. While chanting the prayers, they
        pass their bayas from one to another. The wait for the moon rise begins
        after sunset, and as soon as the moon is sighted, prayers are offered to
        the moon. The fasting women first observe the moon through a sieve and
        then break their fast. The first sip of water and the first morsel of
        food is offered by the husband. A sumptuous dinner follows.<BR>
