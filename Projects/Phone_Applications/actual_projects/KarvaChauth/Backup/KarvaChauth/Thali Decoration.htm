        </TABLE>A decorated thali is a very important component for performing
        the Karva Chauth puja. A puja thali, also known as Baya, containing the
        roli, vermilion, sacred water, dry fruits like almonds, pishta etc.,
        earthen clay pots, diyas and different types of Indian sweets, in their
        respective katoris, is tastefully decorated. The art of creating
        attractive thalis for puja may also contain the ritualistic decoration
        like rangoli and alpana. Puja thali can be decorated with floral designs
        with the help of flowers, leaves, color and also with multicolored
        pulses.<BR>
         <BR>
         On this auspicious day, Ma Gaura or goddess Parvati is worshiped.
        Married women sit around Gaura ma and pray to her for the well being and
        long life of their husbands. A small pitcher or Karva with some water is
        placed in the center. While the story is being narrated, ladies
        circulate their decorated Baya thalis. After the puja, this thali is
        given to the eldest member of the family who blesses the woman with all
        the happiness in life.<BR>
