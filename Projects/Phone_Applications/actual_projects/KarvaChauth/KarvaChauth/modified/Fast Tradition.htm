        </TABLE>In Hindu Dharam, the goal of life is Self-realization or the
        attainment of God and fasting has been a much sought after path to
        attain this. All Hindu fast have a deep spiritual and religious
        significance. According to Hindu scriptures, fasting helps create an
        attachment with the God by establishing a harmonious relationship
        between the body and the soul. This is thought to be imperative for the
        well being of a human being as it nourishes both his/her physical and
        spiritual demands. <BR>

         <BR>
         'Karwa Chauth' is a ritual of fasting observed by married Hindu women
        seeking the longlife, well-being and prosperity of their husbands.
        Married women keep a strict fast and do not take even a drop of water.
        It is the most important and difficult fast observed by married Hindu
        women. It begins before sunrise and ends only after offering prayers and
        worshiping the moon at night. No food or water can be taken after
        sunrise. The fast is broken once the moon is sighted and rituals of the
        day have been performed. At night when the moon appears, women break
        their fast after offering water to the moon. <BR>

         <BR>
         Hindus believe it is not easy to unceasingly pursue the path of
        spirituality in one's daily life. Therefore a worshiper must strive to
        impose restrains on to get the mind focused. And one form of restraint
        is fasting. However, fasting is not only a part of worship, but a great
        instrument for self-discipline too. It is a training of the mind and the
        body to endure and harden up against all hardships, to persevere under
        difficulties and not give up. <BR>

         <BR>
         The ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda sees the basic cause of
        many diseases as the accumulation of toxic materials in the digestive
        system. Regular cleansing of toxic materials keeps one healthy. By
        fasting, the digestive organs get rest and all body mechanisms are
        cleansed and corrected. A complete fast is good for heath, and the
        occasional intake of warm lemon juice during the period of fasting
        prevents the flatulence.<BR>
