         &quot;A long long time ago, there lived a beautiful princess by the
        name of Veeravati. When she was of the marriageable age, Veeravati was
        married to a king. On the occasion of the first Karva Chauth after her
        marriage, she went to her parents&#146; house.&quot;<BR>
         <BR>
         &quot;After sunrise, she observed a strict fast. However, the queen was
        too delicate and couldn&#146;t stand the rigours of fasting. By evening,
        Veeravati was too weak, and fainted. Now, the queen had seven brothers
        who loved her dearly. They couldn&#146;t stand the plight of their
        sister and decided to end her fast by deceiving her. They made a fire at
        the nearby hill and asked their sister to see the glow. They assured her
        that it was the moonlight and since the moon had risen, she could break
        her fast.&quot; <BR>
         <BR>
         &quot;However, the moment the gullible queen ate her dinner, she
        received the news that her husband, the king, was dead. The queen was
        heartbroken and rushed to her husband&#146;s palace. On the way, she met
        Lord Shiva and his consort, Goddess Parvati. Parvati informed her that
        the king had died because the queen had broken her fast by watching a
        false moon. However, when the queen asked her for forgiveness, the
        goddess granted her the boon that the king would be revived but would be
        ill.&quot; <BR>
         <BR>
         &quot;When the queen reached the palace, she found the king lying
        unconscious with hundreds of needles inserted in his body. Each day, the
        queen managed to remove one needle from the king&#146;s body. Next year,
        on the day of Karva Chauth, only one needle remained embedded in the
        body of the unconscious king.&quot; <BR>
         <BR>
         &quot;The queen observed a strict fast that day and when she went to
        the market to buy the karva for the puja , her maid removed the
        remaining needle from the king&#146;s body. The king regained
        consciousness, and mistook the maid for his queen. When the real queen
        returned to the palace, she was made to serve as a maid.&quot; <BR>
         <BR>
         &quot;However, Veeravati was true to her faith and religiously observed
        the Karva Chauth vrat . Once when the king was going to some other
        kingdom, he asked the real queen (now turned maid) if she wanted
        anything. The queen asked for a pair of identical dolls. The king
        obliged and the queen kept singing a song &quot; Roli ki Goli ho gayi...
        Goli ki Roli ho gayi &quot; (the queen has turned into a maid and the
        maid has turned into a queen).&quot; <BR>
         <BR>
         &quot;On being asked by the king as to why did she keep repeating that
        song, Veeravati narrated the entire story. The king repented and
        restored the queen to her royal status. It was only the queen&#146;s
        devotion and her faith that won her husband&#146;s affection and the
        blessings of Goddess Parvati.&quot; </B></DIV><BR>
