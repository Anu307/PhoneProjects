         A long long time ago, there lived a beautiful girl by the name of
        Veeravati. She was the only sister of her seven loving brothers, who was
        married to a king. On the occasion of the first Karva Chauth after her
        marriage, she went to her parents' house. After sunrise, she observed a
        strict fast. However, the queen couldn't stand the rigors of fasting and
        was desperately waiting for the moon to rise. The seven brothers who
        loved her dearly, were very disturbed watching the distress of their
        sister and decided to end her fast by deceiving her. Then the brothers
        reflected a mirror through Pipal tree leaves. The sister, taken it as
        moon rise, broke the fast and took food. However, the moment the queen
        ate her dinner, she received the news that her husband, the king, was
        seriously ill.<BR>
         <BR>
         The queen rushed to her husband's palace and on the way, she met Lord
        Shiva and his consort, Goddess Parvati. Parvati informed her that the
        king had died because the queen had broken her fast by watching a false
        moon. However, when the queen asked her for forgiveness, the goddess
        granted her the boon that the king would be revived. But to achieve
        this, she would have to undertake the Karva Chauth fast under strict
        rituals, then only her husband would come top life. Thus, by strictly
        following all the rituals of Karva chauth, queen Veeravati relivened her
        husband.<BR>

        <B CLASS="txtb">The Legend of Mahabharata</B><BR>
         The belief in this fast and its associated rituals goes back to the
        pre-Mahabharata times. Draupadi, too, is said to have observed this
        fast. Once Arjun went to the Nilgiris for penance and the rest of the
        Pandavas faced many problems in his absence. Draupadi, out of
        desperation, remembered Lord Krishna and asked for help. Lord Krishna
        reminded her that on an earlier occasion, when Goddess Parvati had
        sought Lord Shivas guidance under similar circumstances, she had been
        advised to observe the fast of Karva Chauth. Draupadi followed the
        instructions and observed the fast with all its rituals. Consequently,
        the Pandavas were able to overcome their problems. On this day, fasting
        women listen to Karva Chauth legends with rapt attention.<BR>

        <B CLASS="txtb">The Story of Satyavan and Savitri</B> <BR>
         There is the story of the Satyavan and Savitri. When Lord Yama, came to
        procure Satyavan's soul, Savitri begged him to grant him life. When he
        refused, she stopped eating and drinking and Yamraj finally relented. He
        granted her, her husband's life. To this day, Karva Chauth is celebrated
        with great faith and belief.<BR>
         <BR>
        <B CLASS="txtb">The Legend of Karva</B><BR>
         According to another legend, a woman named Karva was deeply devoted to
        her husband. One day while bathing, he was caught by a crocodile. Karva
        came running and bound the crocodile with a cotton yarn. She then went
        to Yama, the Lord of the death, and requested him to send the offending
        crocodile to hell. When Yama refused, she threatened to curse him.
        Afraid of the power of a devoted wife, Yama readily accepted and sent
        the crocodile to Yamalok or hell, and blessed Karva's husband with long
        life.<BR>
