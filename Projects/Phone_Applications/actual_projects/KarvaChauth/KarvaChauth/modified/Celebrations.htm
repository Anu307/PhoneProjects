        </TABLE>The day of Karva Chauth is celebrated mostly amongst the entire
        North Indian community settled either in India and other parts of the
        world. The most important aspect of this day is that a dawn to dusk fast
        is undertaken by the North Indian ladies and seeing the moon they
        finally break the fast. The Karva Chauth fast is unique perhaps because nowhere in
        the world does a wife go without food or water just to pray for the
        longevity and well-being of her husband. <BR>
