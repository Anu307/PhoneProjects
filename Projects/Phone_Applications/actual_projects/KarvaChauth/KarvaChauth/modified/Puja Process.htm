         Karwa Chauth is considered one of the most important
        fasts observed by the married
        Hindu women. On this day the women pray for the welfare and long life of
        their husbands. The festival is followed mainly in the northern parts of
        the country. <BR>
         <BR>
         Married women eat food early in the morning, before sunrise. They are
        not supposed to eat or even drink water during the day. In the evening
        the ladies listen to the Karwa Chauth Katha (the legend). The fast is
        over after the moonrise. <BR>

        shringar or the traditional adornments and the other
        pooja items like the karwa,
        matthi, heena etc. <BR>
         <BR>
         Early in the morning they prepare food and have it before sunrise. The
        morning passes by in other festive activities like decorating hand and
        feet with heena, decorating the
        pooja thali and
        meeting friends and relatives. <BR>
         <BR>
         In the late afternoon women gather at a common place like temple or a
        garden or someones' place who has arranged the pooja. An elderly lady or
        the pujarin narrates the legend of Karwa Chouth. <BR>

         The essentials of this gathering and listening of the
         Karwa chauth story, a special
        mud pot, that is considered a symbol of lord Ganesha, a metal urn filled
        with water, flowers, idols of Ambika Gaur Mata, Goddess Parwati and some
        fruits, mathi and food grains. A part of this is offered to the deities
        and the storyteller. <BR>
         <BR>

        an idol of Goddess Parwati is kept. Every one lights an earthen lamp in
        their thalis while listening to the Karwa story. Sindoor, incense sticks
        and rice are also kept in the thali. <BR>

        or through a dupatta or a sieve. They offer water to the moon and seek
        blessings. They pray for the safety, prosperity and long life of their
        husbands. This marks the end of the day long fast.<BR>
