        <DIV CLASS="text" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Karva Chauth is of great importance
        for married Hindu women but the festival is seen as a big occasion for
        women undertaking their first Karva Chauth fast after marriage. A newly
        married woman is given utmost importance by relatives and immediate
        family members when she observes her first fast for the long life of her
        husband. She is showered with blessings of blissful married life and
        loads of Karva Chauth gifts especially by her mother-in-law.<BR>
         <BR>
        <B CLASS="txtb">First Sargi</B><BR>
         Mother-in-law prepares an elaborate Sargi (the pre-dawn Karva Chauth
        meal) when her daughter-in-law observes her first fast. She wakes up
        much early to prepare a sumptuous and lavish meal inclusive of sweets
        and other delicacies for daughter-in-law. Saasu-ma blesses her bahu with
        an ashirvaad of &#145;Sada Suhagan Raho&#146; which means, &#145;may you
        always enjoy a blissful married life&#146; when the latter touches her
        feet with reverence. She also presents her daughter-in-law with gifts,
        which may be a piece of jewelry or a heavy saree on the first Karva
        Chauth. <BR>
         <BR>
        <B CLASS="txtb">First Baya</B><BR>
         Baya is a gift given to a daughter&#146;s mother-in-law on the occasion
        of Karva Chauth. It usually consists of salted mathris, dry-fruits and
        some gifts. This Baya is a little more special when the daughter is
        observing her first Karva Chauth. Mothers of newly wed daughters bring
        gifts for all her family members. Some utensils are also included in the
        baya which are to be distributed amongst women who join the newly-wed on
        her first Karva Chauth Puja. <BR>

        <B CLASS="txtb">Elaborate Puja Preparations</B><BR>
         Elaborate preparations are made for the customary evening Karva Chauth
        Puja in a family where a newly wed daughter-in-law observes her first
        Karva-Chauth. Married female relatives are invited to participate in the
        puja. The newly married woman often wears her bridal lehanga or a heavy
        saree and adorns herself with lot of jewelry and make up. After the puja
        ceremony she seeks blessings for happy married life from all elder
        women. The newly wed woman distributes mathris or utensils amongst the
        ladies that were a part of baya.<BR>

        great to see her better half observing such a rigorous fast for him. He

        loads of Karva Chauth gifts. These days husbands also takes her wife out
        for a dinner to save her from the drudgery of day&#146;s cooking work. <BR>
