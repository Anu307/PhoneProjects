        </TABLE>The festival of Karva Chauth was emerged as a day to celebrate
        the season of autumn and enjoy the company of friends and relatives. But
        later on, many mythological legends were added to give it a religious
        touch. This festival is glorified and widely solemnized by the Hindus
        and Sikh of north-western India. As the name signifies, Karva meaning a
        clay pot and chauth corresponding to the fourth, this festival is
        commemorated on the the fourth day after the Full Moon in Kartik month
        of Hindu calendar. <BR>
         <BR>
         A few days before Karva Chauth, married women buy new karvas, the
        spherical clay pots and paint them on the outside with beautiful
        designs. Inside the pot, they put bangles and ribbons, home-made candy
        and sweets, make-up items and small clothes e.g. handkerchief. The women
        then visit each other on the day of Karva Chauth or immediately
        afterward, and exchange these karvas. Season-wise, soon after the
        harvest, it is an excellent time to enjoy festivities, meet one another
        and exchange gifts. During the time of Karva Chauth, parents send gifts
        to married daughters and their children. <BR>

         Usually, falling in the month of October, Karvachauth is celebrated
        midst harvesting of summer crops. Apart from the fast, kept by married
        woman for the long life of their husbands, people like to remember and
        meet their relatives and friends, and exchange gifts with them. Thus,
        Karva Chauth is very much a social and seasonal festival as it is a
        religious affair.<BR>
