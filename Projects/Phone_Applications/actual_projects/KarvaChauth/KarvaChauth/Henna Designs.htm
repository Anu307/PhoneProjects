        </TABLE>The art form of henna or mehndi varies significantly from region
        to region. Varying designs have different meanings for members of each
        culture, such as good health, fertility, wisdom, protection and
        spiritual enlightenment. Various shades of Henna are procured by mixing
        its paste with the leaves and fruit of other plants, such as indigo,
        tea, coffee, cloves and lemon. When used in decorative body art, sugar
        and oil are also added to the mixture to strengthen the color and
        longevity of design. <BR>

         While Arabic henna designs are usually large, floral patterns on the
        hands, Indian mehndi involves fine, thin lines for lacy, floral and
        paisley patterns covering entire hand and also forearms. Most
        traditional henna patterns are based on very simple shapes - circles,
        triangles and lines are the most basic. These shapes can be combined to
        create a very intricate pattern and a very beautiful henna design on
        palm. <BR>

         The various mehendi designs meant for hands include flower arches,
        henna web, flower net, flowery trails, lucky lotus, leaves chains etc.
        While decorating an entire hand, one can start where it is most
        comfortable, depending on the design. Common starting points are the
        line where the fingers bend bordering the palm, the wrist, or the center
        of the palm. It is usually easiest to begin by covering the palm, and
        then doing the fingers.

        patterns with a dye made from crushed leaves of the henna plant. The
        Middle Eastern style consisted mostly of floral patterns inspired by
        Arabic carvings, paintings and textiles. This casual style did not
        usually follow a specific pattern. The North American style accentuated

        and abstract shapes. Applying henna designs on feet are a little more
        difficult, but can be created easily with a bit of concentration.
        Usually, the sides or bottoms of the feet, are decorated with blocks of
        color on the tips of toes.
