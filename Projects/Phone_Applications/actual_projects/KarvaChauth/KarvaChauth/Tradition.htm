        </TABLE>The traditional Indian calendar is one long pageant of colorful
        festivals, a colorful mosaic of festivals, fairs and fasts as diverse as
        the land itself. The festival and fast of Karva Chauth is celebrated
        with much exuberance and fanfare. It is considered an important and
        auspicious day for married women. A married woman celebrates this day
        with great fervor and dedication, by observing a fast and praying for
        the long life of her husband. The fast is observed during the month of
        Kartik on the fourth day of Krishna Paksha (descending moon). This
        generally falls in the month of October. <BR>
         <BR>
         The earliest reference of a Karva Chauth can be found in the great epic
        of Mahabharata. As per Mahabharata, Arjun, a supreme warrior and one of
        the Pandavas, went to the Nilgiri Hills to offer his prayers and worship
        the gods. Draupadi, wife of the Pandavas, was accompanying him. On the
        way, Draupadi was struck with fear believing that she was alone in the
        forest with no one to protect her. As she treated Lord Krishna as her
        Brother, she invoked him to appear before her and help her out of this
        grave situation. <BR>
         <BR>
         On listening to her fear and perplexity, Lord Krishna cited an example
        of Goddess Parvati. Parvati in a similar situation asked Lord Shiva's
        help. Lord Shiva explained to her that to ward off such apprehensions, a
        woman could observe a fast on Kartik Krishna Chaturthi as a remedy. Lord
        Krishna advised Draupadi to undertake this fast and also assured her of
        he victory of the Pandavas. Women also pray to Lord Ganesha for the
        fulfillment of all their wishes. <BR>
         <BR>
         The fast has all the trappings of festivity. Women dress up in their
        best finery, with henna-decked hands, bindis, colorful bangles,
        vermilion in their hair-parting and the best of jewelery. However, they
        do not eat even a morsel of food, neither drink a drop of water, from
        dawn till the moon rises. Finally, when the moon is sighted, the wife
        goes out to view it. The moon is worshiped and then she turns to view
        her husband's face through the pores of a sieve, praying for his long
        life. After performing the puja, its finally time for food.<BR>
