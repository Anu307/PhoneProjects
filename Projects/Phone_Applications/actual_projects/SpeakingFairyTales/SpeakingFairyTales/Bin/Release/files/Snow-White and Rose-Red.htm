widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which
grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red. She had two
children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and
the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world,
always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle
than Rose-red. Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick
flowers and catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and
helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do.
The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand
in hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow- white said, &quot;We
will never desert each other,&quot; Rose-red answered: &quot;No, not as long as
we live&quot;; and the mother added: &quot;Whatever one gets she shall share
with the other.&quot; They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries
and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the
most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their
hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and
the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>No evil
ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them,
they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning, and their mother
knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them. Once, when they
had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they
perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their
resting-place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly, but said nothing, and
vanished into the wood. And when they looked round about them they became aware
that they had slept quite close to a precipice, over which they would certainly
have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness. And when they
told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have
been the angel that guards good children.</span></p>

and Rose-red kept their mother's cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it
was a pleasure to go into it. In summer Rose-red looked after the house, and
every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the
bed, from each tree a rose. In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the
kettle, which was made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like
gold. In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said:
&quot;Snow-white, go and close the shutters,&quot; and they drew round the
fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and
the two girls listened and sat and span. Beside them on the ground lay a little
lamb, and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under
its wings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One
evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though
he desired admittance. The mother said: &quot;Rose-red, open the door quickly;
it must be some traveler seeking shelter.&quot; Rose-red hastened to unbar the
door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it
was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the
door. Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to
bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her
mother's bed. But the bear began to speak, and said: &quot;Don't be afraid: I
won't hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.&quot;
&quot;My poor bear,&quot; said the mother, &quot;lie down by the fire, only
take care you don't burn your fur.&quot; Then she called out: &quot;Snow-white
and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm; he is a good, honest
creature.&quot; So they both came out of their hiding-places, and gradually the
lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the
children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and
scrubbed him till he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the
fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite
at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life. They
tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled
him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he
growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to everything with the best
possible good- nature, only when they went too far he cried: &quot;Oh!
children, spare my life!</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When it
was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said
to the bear: &quot;You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven's name; it will
be shelter for you from the cold and wet.&quot; As soon as day dawned the
children led him out, and he trotted over the snow into the wood. From this
time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the
hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got
so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had
made his appearance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to
Snow-white: &quot;Now I must go away, and not return again the whole
summer.&quot; &quot;Where are you going to, dear bear?&quot; asked Snow-white.
&quot;I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs. In
winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain underground,
for they can't work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and
warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy the land and
steal what they can; what once falls into their hands and into their caves is
not easily brought back to light.&quot; Snow-white was quite sad over their
friend's departure, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear, stepping
out, caught a piece of his fur in the door- knocker, and Snow-white thought she
caught sight of glittering gold beneath it, but she couldn't be certain of it;
and the bear ran hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A short
time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots.
They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground,
and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and
down, but what it was they couldn't distinguish. When they approached nearer
they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of
the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about
like a dog on a chain, and didn't seem to know what he was to do. He glared at
the girls with his fiery red eyes, and screamed out: &quot;What are you
standing there for? Can't you come and help me?&quot; &quot;What were you
doing, little man?&quot; asked Rose-red. &quot;You stupid, inquisitive
goose!&quot; replied the dwarf; &quot;I wanted to split the tree, in order to
get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to
make fires for coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little
food we need. I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well,
but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the tree
closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard out,
so here I am stuck fast, and I can't get away; and you silly, smooth-faced,
milk-and- water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! what wretches you are!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The
children did all in their power, but they couldn't get the beard out; it was
wedged in far too firmly. &quot;I will run and fetch somebody,&quot; said
Rose-red. &quot;Crazy blockheads!&quot; snapped the dwarf; &quot;what's the
good of calling anyone else? You're already two too many for me. Does nothing
better occur to you than that?&quot; &quot;Don't be so impatient,&quot; said
Snow-white, &quot;I'll see you get help,&quot; and taking her scissors out of
her pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself
free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree,
lifted it up, and muttered aloud: &quot;Curse these rude wretches, cutting off
a piece of my splendid beard!&quot; With these words he swung the bag over his
back, and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Shortly
after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish. As they
approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous
grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to jump in. They ran
forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf. &quot;Where are you going
to?&quot; asked Rose-red; &quot;you're surely not going to jump into the water?&quot;
&quot;I'm not such a fool,&quot; screamed the dwarf. &quot;Don't you see that
cursed fish is trying to drag me in?&quot; The little man had been sitting on
the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the
line; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit, the feeble little creature
had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the
dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of
grass, but it didn't help him much; he had to follow every movement of the
fish, and was in great danger of being drawn into the water. The girls came up
just at the right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle
his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless muddle.
Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a
small part of it was sacrificed.</span></p>

dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: &quot;Do you call that
manners, you toad- stools! to disfigure a fellow's face? It wasn't enough that
you shortened my beard before, but you must now needs cut off the best bit of
it. I can't appear like this before my own people. I wish you'd been in Jericho
first.&quot; Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes, and
without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy
needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their road led over a heath where huge
boulders of rock lay scattered here and there. While trudging along they saw a
big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending
lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them. Immediately
afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They ran forward, and saw with
horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about
to carry him off. The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man,
and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey. When the
dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice:
&quot;Couldn't you have treated me more carefully? You have torn my thin little
coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!&quot; Then he took a
bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls
were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their
business in town. On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they
surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he
had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on
the glittering stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the
children stood still and gazed on them. &quot;What are you standing there
gaping for?&quot; screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet
with rage. He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl
was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in
great fright, but he hadn't time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear
was already close to him. Then he cried in terror: &quot;Dear Mr. Bear, spare
me! I'll give you all my treasure. Look at those beautiful precious stones
lying there. Spare my life! what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little
fellow like me? You won't feel me between your teeth. There, lay hold of these
two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails;
eat them up, for heaven's sake.&quot; But the bear, paying no attention to his
words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved
again.</span></p>

had run away, but the bear called after them: &quot;Snow-white and Rose-red,
don't be afraid; wait, and I'll come with you.&quot; Then they recognized his
voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin
suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold.
&quot;I am a king's son,&quot; he said, &quot;and have been doomed by that
unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a
wild bear till his death should set me free. Now he has got his well-merited
punishment.&quot;</span></p>

married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the great treasure the
dwarf had collected in his cave between them. The old mother lived for many
years peacefully with her children; and she carried the two rose trees with
her, and they stood in front of her window, and every year they bore the finest
red and white roses.</span></p>
