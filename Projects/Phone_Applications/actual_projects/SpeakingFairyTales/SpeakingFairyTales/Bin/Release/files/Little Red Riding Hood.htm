<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe WP Semibold","sans-serif"'>Little
Red Riding Hood</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time there lived in a certain
village a little country girl, the prettiest creature was ever seen. Her mother
was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This
good woman had made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so
extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day her mother, having made some custards,
said to her:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma
does, for I hear she has been very ill; carry her a custard, and this little
pot of butter.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go
to her grandmother, who lived in another village.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As she was going through the wood, she met with
Gaffer Wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because
of some faggot-makers hard by in the forest. He asked her whither she was
going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear
a wolf talk, said to him:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am going to see my grandmamma and carry
her a custard and a little pot of butter from my mamma.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Does she live far off?&quot; said the
Wolf.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! ay,&quot; answered Little Red
Riding-Hood; &quot;it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in
the village.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well,&quot; said the Wolf, &quot;and I'll
go and see her too. I'll go this way and you go that, and we shall see who will
be there soonest.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Wolf began to run as fast as he could,
taking the nearest way, and the little girl went by that farthest about,
diverting herself in gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making
nosegays of such little flowers as she met with. The Wolf was not long before
he got to the old woman's house. He knocked at the door--tap, tap.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who's there?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your grandchild, Little Red
Riding-Hood,&quot; replied the Wolf, counterfeiting her voice; &quot;who has
brought you a custard and a little pot of butter sent you by mamma.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she
was somewhat ill, cried out</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go
up.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened,
and then presently he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for
it was above three days that he had not touched a bit. He then shut the door
and went into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding- Hood, who
came some time afterward and knocked at the door--tap, tap.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who's there?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of
the Wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and
was hoarse, answered:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot; 'Tis your grandchild, Little Red
Riding-Hood, who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma
sends you.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice
as much as he could:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go
up.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and
the door opened.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her,
hiding himself under the bed-clothes:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Put the custard and the little pot of
butter upon the stool, and come and lie down with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and
went into bed, where, being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in
her night-clothes, she said to her:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandmamma, what great arms you have
got!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is the better to hug thee, my
dear.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandmamma, what great legs you have
got!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is to run the better, my child.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandmamma, what great ears you have
got!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is to hear the better, my
child.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandmamma, what great eyes you have
got!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is to see the better, my child.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandmamma, what great teeth you have
got!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is to eat thee up.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell
upon Little Red Riding-Hood, and ate her all up.</span></p>
