gentleness and good behavior gained so far on the Emperor and his Court, and,
indeed, on the people in general, that I began to have hopes of getting my
liberty in a short time. The natives came by degrees to be less fearful of
danger from me. I would sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on
my hand; and at last the boys and girls ventured to come and play at hide-
and-seek in my hair.</span></p>

of the army and of the royal stables were no longer shy, having been daily led
before me; and one of the Emperor s huntsmen, on a large courser, took my foot,
shoe and all, which was indeed a prodigious leap. I amused the Emperor one day
in a very extraordinary manner. I took nine sticks, and fixed them firmly in
the ground in a square. Then I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel
at each corner, about two feet from the ground. I fastened my handkerchief to
the nine sticks that stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as
tight as the top of a drum; and I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his
best horse, twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His
majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one, with the
proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they got into order they divided
into two parties, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and pursued,
and, in short, showed the best military discipline I ever beheld. The parallel
sticks secured them and their horses from falling off the stage, and the
Emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated
several days, and persuaded the Empress herself to let me hold her in her chair
within two yards of the stage, whence she could view the whole performance.
Fortunately no accident happened, only once a fiery horse, pawing with his
hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and overthrew his rider and himself.
But I immediately relieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I
set down the troop with the other as I had taken them up. The horse that fell
was strained in the shoulder; but the rider was not hurt, and I repaired my
handkerchief as well as I could. However, I would not trust to the strength of
it any more in such dangerous enterprises.</span></p>

so many petitions for my liberty that his Majesty at length mentioned the
matter in a full council, where it was opposed by none except Skyresh Bolgolam,
admiral of the realm, who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy.
However, he agreed at length, though he succeeded in himself drawing up the
conditions on which I should be set free. After they were read I was requested
to swear to perform them in the method prescribed by their laws, which was to
hold my right foot in my left hand, and to place the middle finger of my right
hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the top of my right ear. But I
have made a translation of the conditions, which I here offer to the public:</span></p>

morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my freedom, Reldresal, the
Emperor's secretary for private affairs, came to my house, attended only by one
servant. He ordered his coach to wait at a distance, and desired that I would
give him an hour's audience. I offered to lie down that he might the more
conveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand
during our conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty, but he added
that, save for the present state of things at Court, perhaps I might not have
obtained it so soon. &quot;For,&quot; he said, &quot;however flourishing we may
seem to foreigners, we are in danger of an invasion from the island of
Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe, almost as large and
as powerful as this of his Majesty. For as to what we have heard you say, that
there are other kingdoms in the world, inhabited by human creatures as large as
yourself, our philosophers are very doubtful, and rather conjecture that you
dropped from the moon, or one of the stars, because a hundred mortals of your
size would soon destroy all the fruit and cattle of his Majesty's dominions.
Besides, our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other
regions than the two mighty empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu, which, as I was
going to tell you, are engaged in a most obstinate war, which began in the
following manner: It is allowed on all hands that the primitive way of breaking
eggs was upon the larger end; but his present Majesty's grandfather, while he
was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient
practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon the Emperor, his
father, made a law commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end of
their eggs. The people so highly resented this law that there have been six
rebellions raised on that account, wherein one emperor lost his life, and
another his crown. It is calculated that eleven hundred persons have at
different times suffered rather than break their eggs at the smaller end. But
these rebels, the Bigendians, have found so much encouragement at the Emperor
of Blefuscu's Court, to which they always fled for refuge, that a bloody war,
as I said, has been carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty
moons; and now the Blefuscudians have equipped a large fleet, and are preparing
to descend upon us. Therefore his Imperial Majesty, placing great confidence in
your valor and strength, has commanded me to set the case before you.&quot;</span></p>

that I was ready, at the risk of my life, to defend him against all invaders.</span></p>
