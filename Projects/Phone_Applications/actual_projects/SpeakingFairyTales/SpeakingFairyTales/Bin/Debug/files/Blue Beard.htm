a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold
plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold. But this
man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard, which made him so frightfully ugly
that all the women and girls ran away from him.</span></p>

neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties. He
desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to her choice which of the two
she would bestow on him. They would neither of them have him, and sent him
backward and forward from one another, not being able to bear the thoughts of
marrying a man who had a blue beard, and what besides gave them disgust and
aversion was his having already been married to several wives, and nobody ever
knew what became of them.</span></p>

Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their mother and
three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young people of the

nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing,
mirth, and feasting. Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in rallying
and joking with each other. In short, everything succeeded so well that the
youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so
very blue, and that he was a mighty civil gentleman.</span></p>

they returned home, the marriage was concluded. About a month afterward, Blue
Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks
at least, about affairs of very great consequence, desiring her to divert
herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to carry
them into the country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was.</span></p>

said he, &quot;are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best
furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which is not every day in
use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money, both gold and silver;
these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments.
But for this little one here, it is the key of the closet at the end of the
great gallery on the ground floor. Open them all; go into all and every one of
them, except that little closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a
manner that, if you happen to open it, there's nothing but what you may expect
from my just anger and resentment.&quot;</span></p>

neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady,
so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house, not
daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which
frightened them. They ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which
were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another.</span></p>

they went up into the two great rooms, where was the best and richest
furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the
tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking- glasses, in
which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with
glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent
ever were seen.</span></p>

ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in the meantime
in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things, because of
the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor. She was
so much pressed by her curiosity that, without considering that it was very
uncivil to leave her company, she went down a little back staircase, and with
such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.</span></p>

the closet-door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon her husband's
orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was
disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it. She
then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but could not at first see
anything plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began
to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, on which
lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls. (These were all
the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after another.) She
thought she should have died for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the
lock, fell out of her hand.</span></p>

having somewhat recovered her surprise, she took up the key, locked the door,
and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself; but she could not, she
was so much frightened. Having observed that the key of the closet was stained
with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would
not come out; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand; the
blood still remained, for the key was magical and she could never make it quite
clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.</span></p>

returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had received letters
upon the road, in- forming him that the affair he went about was ended to his
advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of
his speedy return.</span></p>

very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a
sudden stop. The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who,
drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue Beard. He knew them to be his wife's
brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer, so that he ran away immediately
to save himself; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him
before he could get to the steps of the porch, when they ran their swords
through his body and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her
husband, and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers.</span></p>

had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She made use
of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved
her a long while; another part to buy captains commissions for her brothers,
and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget
the ill time she had passed with Blue Beard.</span></p>
