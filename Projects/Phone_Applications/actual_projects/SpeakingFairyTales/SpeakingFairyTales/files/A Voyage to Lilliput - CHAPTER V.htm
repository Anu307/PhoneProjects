after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the northeast coast of the
island, I observed at some distance in the sea something that looked like a
boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and wading two or three
hundred yards, I plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might by
some tempest have been driven from a ship. I returned immediately to the city
for help, and after a huge amount of labor I managed to get my boat to the
royal port of Blefuscu, where a great crowd of people appeared, full of wonder
at sight of so prodigious a vessel. I told the Emperor that my good fortune had
thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence I might return to
my native country, and begged his orders for materials to fit it up, and leave
to depart--which, after many kindly speeches, he was pleased to grant.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meanwhile
the Emperor of Lilliput, uneasy at my long absence (but never imagining that I
had the least notice of his designs), sent a person of rank to inform the
Emperor of Blefuscu of my disgrace; this messenger had orders to represent the
great mercy of his master, who was content to punish me with the loss of my
eyes, and who expected that his brother of Blefuscu would have me sent back to
Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished as a traitor. The Emperor of
Blefuscu answered with many civil excuses. He said that as for sending me
bound, his brother knew it was impossible. Moreover, though I had taken away
his fleet he was grateful to me for many good offices I had done him in making
the peace. But that both their Majesties would soon be made easy; for I had
found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he
had given orders to fit up; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be
free from me.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With this
answer the messenger returned to Lilliput; and I (though the monarch of
Blefuscu secretly offered me his gracious protection if I would continue in his
service) hastened my departure, resolving never more to put confidence in
princes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In about a
month I was ready to take leave. The Emperor of Blefuscu, with the Empress and
the royal family, came out of the palace; and I lay down on my face to kiss
their hands, which they graciously gave me. His Majesty presented me with fifty
purses of sprugs (their greatest gold coin) and his picture at full length,
which I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. Many
other ceremonies took place at my departure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I stored
the boat with meat and drink, and took six cows and two bulls alive, with as
many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own country; and to feed
them on board, I had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn. I would gladly
have taken a dozen of the natives; but this was a thing the Emperor would by no
means permit, and besides a diligent search into my pockets, his Majesty
pledged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects, though with their own
consent and desire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having
thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail. When I had made
twenty-four leagues, by my reckoning, from the island of Blefuscu, I saw a sail
steering to the northeast. I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I
gained upon her, for the wind slackened; and in half an hour she spied me, and
discharged a gun. I came up with her between five and six in the evening, Sept.
26, 1701; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors. I put my
cows and sheep into my coat pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo.
The captain received me with kindness, and asked me to tell him what place I
came from last; but at my answer he thought I was raving. However, I took my
black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment,
clearly convinced him.</span></p>

in England on the 13th of April, 1702. I stayed two months with my wife and
family; but my eager desire to see foreign countries would suffer me to remain
no longer. However, while in England I made great profit by showing my cattle
to persons of quality and others; and before I began my second voyage I sold
them for 600l. I left 1500l. with my wife, and fixed her in a good house; then
taking leave of her and my boy and girl, with tears on both sides, I sailed on
board the &quot;Adventure.&quot;</span></p>
