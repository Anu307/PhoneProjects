about two hours the Court retired, and I was left with a strong guard to keep
away the crowd, some of whom had had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me
as I sat by the door of my house. But the colonel ordered six of them to be
seized and delivered bound into my hands. I put five of them into my coat
pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a face as if I would eat him alive. The
poor man screamed terribly, and the colonel and his officers were much
distressed, especially when they saw me take out my penknife. But I soon set
them at ease, for, cutting the strings he was bound with, I put him gently on
the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them
one by one out of my pocket; and I saw that both the soldiers and people were
delighted at this mark of my kindness</span></p>

night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on the ground, as I

hundred servants were appointed me, and three hundred tailors made me a suit of
clothes. Moreover, six of his Majesty's greatest scholars were employed to
teach me their language, so that soon I was able to converse after a fashion
with the Emperor, who often honored me with his visits. The first words I
learned were to desire that he would please to give me my liberty, which I
every day repeated on my knees; but he answered that this must be a work of
time, and that first I must swear a peace with him and his kingdom. He told me
also that by the laws of the nation I must be searched by two of his officers,
and that as this could not be done without my help, he trusted them in my
hands, and whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the
country. I took up the two officers, and put them into my coat pockets. These
gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper about them, made an exact list of
everything they saw, which I afterward translated into English, and which ran
as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

the right coat pocket of the great Man-Mountain we found only one great piece
of coarse cloth, large enough to cover the carpet of your Majesty's chief room
of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a silver cover,
which we could not lift. We desired that it should be opened, and one of us
stepping into it found himself up to the mid-leg in a sort of dust, some of
which flying into our faces sent us both into a fit of sneezing. In his right
waistcoat pocket we found a number of white thin substances, folded one over
another, about the size of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with
black figures, which we humbly conceive to be writings. In the left there was a
sort of engine, from the back of which extended twenty long poles, with which,
we conjecture, the Man-Mountain combs his head. In the smaller pocket on the
right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different
sizes. Some of the white, which appeared to be silver, were so large and heavy
that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. From another pocket hung a huge
silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine fastened to it, a globe half
silver and half of some transparent metal; for on the transparent side we saw
certain strange figures, and thought we could touch them till we found our
fingers stopped by the shin- ing substance. This engine made an incessant
noise, like a water-mill, and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal,
or the god he worships, but probably the latter, for he told us that he seldom
did anything without consulting it.</span></p>

think myself bound in honor to discover.</span></p>
