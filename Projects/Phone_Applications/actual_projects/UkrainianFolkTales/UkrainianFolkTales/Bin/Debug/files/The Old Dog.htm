<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Old
Dog</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was once a man who
had a dog. While the dog was young he was made much of, but when he grew old he
was driven out of doors. So he went and lay outside the fence, and a wolf came
up to him and said, “Doggy, why so down in the mouth?”––“While I was young,”
said the dog, “they made much of me; but now that I am old they beat me.” The
wolf said, “I see thy master in the field; go after him, and perchance he’ll
give thee something.”––“Nay,” said the dog, “they won’t even let me walk about
the fields now, they only beat me.”––“Look now,” said the wolf, “I’m sorry, and
will make things better for thee. Thy mistress, I see, has put her child down
beneath that wagon. I’ll seize it, and make off with it. Run thou after me and
bark, and though thou hast no teeth left, touzle me as much as thou canst, so
that thy mistress may see it.”</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the wolf seized the
child, and ran away with it, and the dog ran after him, and began to touzle
him. His mistress saw it, and made after them with a harrow, crying at the same
time, “Husband, husband! the wolf has got the child! Gabriel, Gabriel! don’t
you see? The wolf has got the child!” Then the man chased the wolf, and got
back the child. “Brave old dog!” said he; “you are old and toothless, and yet
you can give help in time of need, and will not let your master’s child be
stolen.” And henceforth the woman and her husband gave the old dog a large lump
of bread every day</span></p>
