<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The
Origin of the Mole</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time a rich
man and a poor man had a field in common, and they sowed it with the same seed
at the same time. But God prospered the poor man’s labour and made his seed to
grow, but the rich man’s seed did not grow. Then the rich man claimed that part
of the field where the grain had sprung up, and said to the poor man, “Look
now! ’tis my seed that has prospered, and not thine!” The poor man protested,
but the rich man would not listen, but said to him, “If thou wilt not believe
me, then, poor man, come into the field quite early to-morrow morning, before
dawn, and God shall judge betwixt us.”</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the poor man went
home. But the rich man dug a deep trench in the poor man’s part of the field
and placed his son in it, and said to him, “Look now, my son; when I come
hither to-morrow morning and ask whose field this is, say that it is not the
poor man’s, but the rich man’s.”</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he well covered up
his son with straw, and departed to his own house.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the morning all the
people assembled together and went to the field, and the rich man cried,
“Speak, O God! whose field is this, the rich man’s or the poor man’s?”</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>“The rich man’s, the
rich man’s,” cried a voice from the midst of the field.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the Lord Himself was
among the people gathered together there, and He said, “Listen not to that
voice, for the field is verily the poor man’s.”</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the Lord told all
the people how the matter went, and then He said to the son of the rich man,</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>“Stay where thou art,
and sit beneath the earth all thy days, so long as the sun is in the sky.”</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the rich man’s son
became a mole on the spot, and that is why the mole always flies the light of
day.</span></p>
