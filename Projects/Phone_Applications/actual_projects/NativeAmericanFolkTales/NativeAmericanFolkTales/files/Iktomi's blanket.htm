<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi's
blanket</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Alone within his teepee sat Iktomi. The sun was
but a handsbreadth from the western edge of land. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Those, bad, bad gray wolves! They ate up
all my nice fat ducks!&quot; muttered he, rocking his body to and fro. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was cuddling the evil memory he bore those hungry
wolves. At last he ceased to sway his body backward and forward, but sat still
and stiff as a stone image. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! I'll go to Inyan, the
great-grandfather, and pray for food!&quot; he exclaimed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At once he hurried forth from his teepee and,
with his blanket over one shoulder, drew nigh to a huge rock on a hillside. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With half-crouching, half-running strides, he
fell upon Inyan with outspread hands. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandfather! pity me. I am hungry. I am
starving. Give me food. Great-grandfather, give me meat to eat!&quot; he cried.
All the while he stroked and caressed the face of the great stone god. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The all-powerful Great Spirit, who makes the
trees and grass, can hear the voice of those who pray in many varied ways. The
hearing of Inyan, the large hard stone, was the one most sought after. He was
the great-grandfather, for he had sat upon the hillside many, many seasons. He
had seen the prairie put on a snow-white blanket and then change it for a
bright green robe more than a thousand times. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Still unaffected by the myriad moons he rested
on the everlasting hill, listening to the prayers of Indian warriors. Before
the finding of the magic arrow he had sat there. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now, as Iktomi prayed and wept before the
great-grandfather, the sky in the west was red like a glowing face. The sunset
poured a soft mellow light upon the huge gray stone and the solitary figure
beside it. It was the smile of the Great Spirit upon the grandfather and the
wayward child. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prayer was heard. Iktomi knew it. &quot;Now,
grandfather, accept my offering; 'tis all I have,&quot; said Iktomi as he
spread his half-worn blanket upon Inyan's cold shoulders. Then Iktomi, happy
with the smile of the sunset sky, followed a footpath leading toward a
thicketed ravine. He had not gone many paces into the shrubbery when before him
lay a freshly wounded deer! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is the answer from the red western
sky!&quot; cried Iktomi with hands uplifted. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Slipping a long thin blade from out his belt, he
cut large chunks of choice meat. Sharpening some willow sticks, he planted them
around a wood-pile he had ready to kindle. On these stakes he meant to roast
the venison. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While he was rubbing briskly two long sticks to
start a fire, the sun in the west fell out of the sky below the edge of land.
Twilight was over all. Iktomi felt the cold night air upon his bare neck and
shoulders. &quot;Ough!&quot; he shivered as he wiped his knife on the grass.
Tucking it in a beaded case hanging from his belt, Iktomi stood erect, looking
about. He shivered again. &quot;Ough! Ah! I am cold. I wish I had my
blanket!&quot; whispered he, hovering over the pile of dry sticks and the sharp
stakes round about it. Suddenly he paused and dropped his hands at his sides. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The old great-grandfather does not feel
the cold as I do. He does not need my old blanket as I do. I wish I had not
given it to him. Oh! I think I'll run up there and take it back!&quot; said he,
pointing his long chin toward the large gray stone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi, in the warm sunshine, had no need of his
blanket, and it had been very easy to part with a thing which he could not miss.
But the chilly night wind quite froze his ardent thank-offering. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus running up the hillside, his teeth
chattering all the way, he drew near to Inyan, the sacred symbol. Seizing one
corner of the half-worn blanket, Iktomi pulled it off with a jerk. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Give my blanket back, old grandfather! You
do not need it. I do!&quot; This was very wrong, yet Iktomi did it, for his wit
was not wisdom. Drawing the blanket tight over his shoulders, he descended the
hill with hurrying feet. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was soon upon the edge of the ravine. A young
moon, like a bright bent bow, climbed up from the southwest horizon a little
way into the sky. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In this pale light Iktomi stood motionless as a
ghost amid the thicket. His woodpile was not yet kindled. His pointed stakes
were still bare as he had left them. But where was the deer—the venison he had
felt warm in his hands a moment ago? It was gone. Only the dry rib bones lay on
the ground like giant fingers from an open grave. Iktomi was troubled. At
length, stooping over the white dried bones, he took hold of one and shook it.
The bones, loose in their sockets, rattled together at his touch. Iktomi let go
his hold. He sprang back amazed. And though he wore a blanket his teeth
chattered more than ever. Then his blunted sense will surprise you, little
reader; for instead of being grieved that he had taken back his blanket, he
cried aloud, &quot;Hin-hin-hin! If only I had eaten the venison before going
for my blanket!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Those tears no longer moved the hand of the
Generous Giver. They were selfish tears. The Great Spirit does not heed them
ever. </span></p>
