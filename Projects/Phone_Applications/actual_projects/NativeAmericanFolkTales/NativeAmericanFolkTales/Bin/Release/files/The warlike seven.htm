<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The
warlike seven</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once seven people went out to make war,—the
Ashes, the Fire, the Bladder, the Grasshopper, the Dragon Fly, the Fish, and
the Turtle. As they were talking excitedly, waving their fists in violent
gestures, a wind came and blew the Ashes away. &quot;Ho!&quot; cried the
others, &quot;he could not fight, this one!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The six went on running to make war more
quickly. They descended a deep valley, the Fire going foremost until they came
to a river. The Fire said &quot;Hsss—tchu!&quot; and was gone. &quot;Ho!&quot;
hooted the others, &quot;he could not fight, this one!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Therefore the five went on the more quickly to
make war. They came to a great wood. While they were going through it, the
Bladder was heard to sneer and to say, &quot;He! you should rise above these,
brothers.&quot; With these words he went upward among the tree-tops; and the
thorn apple pricked him. He fell through the branches and was nothing!
&quot;You see this!&quot; said the four, &quot;this one could not fight.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Still the remaining warriors would not turn
back. The four went boldly on to make war. The Grasshopper with his cousin, the
Dragon Fly, went foremost. They reached a marshy place, and the mire was very
deep. As they waded through the mud, the Grasshopper's legs stuck, and he
pulled them off! He crawled upon a log and wept, &quot;You see me, brothers, I
cannot go!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Dragon Fly went on, weeping for his cousin.
He would not be comforted, for he loved his cousin dearly. The more he grieved,
the louder he cried, till his body shook with great violence. He blew his red
swollen nose with a loud noise so that his head came off his slender neck, and
he was fallen upon the grass. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You see how it is,&quot; said the Fish,
lashing his tail impatiently, &quot;these people were not warriors!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Come!&quot; he said, &quot;let us go on to
make war.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus the Fish and the Turtle came to a large
camp ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho!&quot; exclaimed the people of this
round village of teepees, &quot;Who are these little ones? What do they
seek?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Neither of the warriors carried weapons with
them, and their unimposing stature misled the curious people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Fish was spokesman. With a peculiar omission
of syllables, he said: &quot;Shu... hi pi!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wan! what? what?&quot; clamored eager
voices of men and women. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Again the Fish said: &quot;Shu... hi pi!&quot;
Everywhere stood young and old with a palm to an ear. Still no one guessed what
the Fish had mumbled! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From the bewildered crowd witty old Iktomi came
forward. &quot;He, listen!&quot; he shouted, rubbing his mischievous palms
together, for where there was any trouble brewing, he was always in the midst
of it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This little strange man says, 'Zuya
unhipi! We come to make war!'&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Uun!&quot; resented the people, suddenly
stricken glum. &quot;Let us kill the silly pair! They can do nothing! They do
not know the meaning of the phrase. Let us build a fire and boil them
both!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you put us on to boil,&quot; said the
Fish, &quot;there will be trouble.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho ho!&quot; laughed the village folk.
&quot;We shall see.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And so they made a fire. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have never been so angered!&quot; said
the Fish. The Turtle in a whispered reply said: &quot;We shall die!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When a pair of strong hands lifted the Fish over
the sputtering water, he put his mouth downward. &quot;Whssh!&quot; he said. He
blew the water all over the people, so that many were burned and could not see.
Screaming with pain, they ran away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, what shall we do with these dreadful
ones?&quot; they said. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Others exclaimed: &quot;Let us carry them to the
lake of muddy water and drown them!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Instantly they ran with them. They threw the
Fish and the Turtle into the lake. Toward the center of the large lake the
Turtle dived. There he peeped up out of the water and, waving a hand at the
crowd, sang out, &quot;This is where I live!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Fish swam hither and thither with such
frolicsome darts that his back fin made the water fly. &quot;E han!&quot;
whooped the Fish, &quot;this is where I live!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, what have we done!&quot; said the
frightened people, &quot;this will be our undoing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then a wise chief said: &quot;Iya, the Eater,
shall come and swallow the lake!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So one went running. He brought Iya, the Eater;
and Iya drank all day at the lake till his belly was like the earth. Then the
Fish and the Turtle dived into the mud; and Iya said: &quot;They are not in
me.&quot; Hearing this the people cried greatly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi wading in the lake had been swallowed
like a gnat in the water. Within the great Iya he was looking skyward. So deep
was the water in the Eater's stomach that the surface of the swallowed lake
almost touched the sky. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will go that way,&quot; said Iktomi,
looking at the concave within arm's reach. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He struck his knife upward in the Eater's
stomach, and the water falling out drowned those people of the village. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now when the great water fell into its own bed,
the Fish and the Turtle came to the shore. They went home painted victors and
loud-voiced singers. </span></p>
