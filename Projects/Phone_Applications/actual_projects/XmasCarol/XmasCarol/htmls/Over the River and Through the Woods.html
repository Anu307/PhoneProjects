<H2>Over the River and Through the Woods</H2>
<P><B>O</B>ver the river and through the woods <BR>To Grandmother's house we go. <BR>The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh <BR>Through white and drifted snow. 
<P><B>O</B>ver the river and through the woods, <BR>Oh, how the wind does blow. <BR>It stings the toes and bites the nose <BR>As over the ground we go. 
<P><B>O</B>ver the river and through the woods <BR>To have a full day of play. <BR>Oh, hear the bells ringing ting-a-ling-ling, <BR>For it is Christmas Day. 
<P><B>O</B>ver the river and through the woods, <BR>Trot fast my dapple gray; <BR>Spring o'er the ground just iike a hound, <BR>For this is Christmas Day. 
<P><B>O</B>ver the river and through the woods <BR>And straight through the barnyard gate. <BR>It seems that we go so dreadfully slow; <BR>It is so hard to wait. 
<P><B>O</B>ver the river and through the woods, <BR>Now Grandma's cap I spy. <BR>Hurrah for fun; the pudding's done; <BR>Hurrah for the pumpkin pie.<BR>
