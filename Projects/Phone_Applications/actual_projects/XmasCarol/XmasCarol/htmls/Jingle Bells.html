<H2>Jingle Bells</H2>
<P><B>D</B>ashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh, <BR>Over the fields we go, laughing all the way. <BR>Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright, <BR>What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight. 
<P><I><B>Chorus</B> <BR>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! <BR>O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. <BR>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! <BR>O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.</I> 
<P><B>A</B> day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride <BR>And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side; <BR>The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot; <BR>He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot 
<P><I>(Chorus)</I> 
<P><B>A</B> day or two ago, the story I must tell <BR>I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell; <BR>A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh <BR>He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away 
<P><I>(Chorus)</I> 
<P><B>N</B>ow the ground is white, go it while you're young <BR>Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song; <BR>Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed <BR>Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead 
<P><I>(Chorus)</I> <BR>
