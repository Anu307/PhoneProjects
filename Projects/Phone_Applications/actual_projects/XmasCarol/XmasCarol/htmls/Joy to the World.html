<H2>Joy to the World</H2>
<P><B>J</B>oy to the world! the Lord is come; <BR>Let earth receive her King; <BR>Let every heart prepare Him room, <BR>and heaven and nature sing, <BR>and heaven and nature sing, <BR>and heaven, and heaven and nature sing. 
<P><B>J</B>oy to the earth! the Savior reigns; <BR>Let men their songs employ; <BR>while fields and floods, <BR>rocks, hills and plains <BR>Repeat the sounding joy, <BR>Repeat the sounding joy, <BR>Repeat, repeat the sounding joy. 
<P><B>N</B>o more let sins and sorrows grow, <BR>nor thorns infest the ground; <BR>He comes to make His blessing flow <BR>far as the curse is found, <BR>far as the curse is found, <BR>far as, far as the curse is found. 
<P><B>H</B>e rules the world with truth and grace, <BR>and makes the nations prove <BR>the glories of His righteousness, <BR>and wonders of His love, <BR>and wonders of His love, <BR>and wonders, wonders of His love. <BR>
