        <b>S</b>aid the night wind to the little lamb,
        <br />
        &quot;Do you see what I see?
        <br />
        Way up in the sky, little lamb,
        <br />
        Do you see what I see?
        <br />
        A star, a star, dancing in the night
        <br />
        With a tail as big as a kite,
        <br />
        With a tail as big as a kite.&quot;

        <b>S</b>aid the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
        <br />
        &quot;Do you hear what I hear?
        <br />
        Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
        <br />
        Do you hear what I hear?
        <br />
        A song, a song high above the trees
        <br />
        With a voice as big as the the sea,
        <br />
        With a voice as big as the the sea.&quot;

    <p>
        <b>S</b>aid the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
        <br />
        &quot;Do you know what I know?
        <br />
        In your palace warm, mighty king,
        <br />
        Do you know what I know?
        <br />
        A Child, a Child shivers in the cold--
        <br />
        Let us bring him silver and gold,
        <br />
        Let us bring him silver and gold.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>S</b>aid the king to the people everywhere,
        <br />
        &quot;Listen to what I say!
        <br />
        Pray for peace, people, everywhere,
        <br />
        Listen to what I say!
        <br />
        The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
        <br />
        He will bring us goodness and light,
        <br />
        He will bring us goodness and light.&quot;
