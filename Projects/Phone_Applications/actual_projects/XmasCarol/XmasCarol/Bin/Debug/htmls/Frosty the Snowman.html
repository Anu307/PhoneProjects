<H2>Frosty the Snowman</H2>
<P><B>F</B>rosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul, <BR>With a corncob pipe and a button nose, <BR>And two eyes made out of coal. <BR>Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say, <BR>He was made of snow but the children <BR>know how he came to life one day. <BR>There must have been some magic in that <BR>Old silk hat they found. <BR>For when they placed it on his head, <BR>He began to dance around. 
<P><B>O</B>, Frosty the snowman <BR>Was alive as he could be, <BR>And the children say he could laugh <BR>And play just the same as you and me. <BR>Thumpetty thump thump, <BR>Thumpety thump thump, <BR>Look at Frosty go. <BR>Thumpetty thump thump, <BR>Thumpety thump thump, <BR>Over the hills of snow. 
<P><B>F</B>rosty the snowman knew <BR>The sun was hot that day, <BR>So he said, "Let's run and <BR>we'll have some fun <BR>now before I melt away." <BR>Down to the village, <BR>With a broomstick in his hand, <BR>Running here and there all <BR>Around the square saying, <BR>Catch me if you can. <BR>He led them down the streets of town <BR>Right to the traffic cop. <BR>And he only paused a moment when <BR>He heard him holler "Stop!" 
<P><B>F</B>or Frosty the snowman <BR>Had to hurry on his way, <BR>But he waved goodbye saying, <BR>"Don't you cry, <BR>I'll be back again some day." <BR>Thumpetty thump thump, <BR>Thumpety thump thump, <BR>Look at Frosty go. <BR>Thumpetty thump thump, <BR>Thumpety thump thump, <BR>Over the hills of snow. <BR>
