    <H2>Oh Little Town of Bethlehem</H2>
<P><B>O</B> little town of Bethlehem, <BR>How still we see thee lie! <BR>Above thy deep and dreamless sleep <BR>The silent stars go by; <BR>Yet in thy dark streets shineth <BR>The everlasting Light; <BR>The hopes and fears of all the years <BR>Are met in thee to-night. 
<P><B>F</B>or Christ is born of Mary, <BR>And gathered all above, <BR>While mortals sleep, the angels keep <BR>Their watch of wondering love. <BR>O morning stars, together <BR>Proclaim the holy birth! <BR>And praises sing to God the King, <BR>And peace to men on earth. 
<P><B>H</B>ow silently, how silently, <BR>The wondrous gift is given! <BR>So God imparts to human hearts <BR>The blessings of his heaven. <BR>No ear may hear his coming, <BR>But in this world of sin, <BR>Where meek souls will receive him, still <BR>The dear Christ enters in. 
<P><B>W</B>here children pure and happy <BR>Pray to the blessed Child, <BR>Where misery cries out to thee, <BR>Son of the mother mild; <BR>Where charity stands watching <BR>And faith holds wide the door, <BR>The dark night wakes, the glory breaks, <BR>And Christmas comes once more. 
<P><B>O</B> holy Child of Bethlehem! <BR>Descend to us, we pray; <BR>Cast out our sin and enter in, <BR>Be born in us to-day. <BR>We hear the Christmas angels <BR>The great glad tidings tell; <BR>O come to us, abide with us, <BR>Our Lord Emmanuel!<BR>
