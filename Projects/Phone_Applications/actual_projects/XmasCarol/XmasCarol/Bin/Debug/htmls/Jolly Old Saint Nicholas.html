<H2>Jolly Old Saint Nicholas</H2>
<P><B>J</B>olly old Saint Nicholas, <BR>Lean your ear this way! <BR>Don't you tell a single soul <BR>What I'm going to say; <BR>Christmas Eve is coming soon; <BR>Now, you dear old man, <BR>Whisper what you'll bring to me; <BR>Tell me if you can. 
<P><B>W</B>hen the clock is striking twelve, <BR>When I'm fast asleep, <BR>Down the chimney broad and black, <BR>With your pack you'll creep; <BR>All the stockings you will find <BR>Hanging in a row; <BR>Mine will be the shortest one, <BR>You'll be sure to know. 
<P><B>J</B>ohnny wants a pair of skates; <BR>Susy wants a dolly; <BR>Nellie wants a story book; <BR>She thinks dolls are folly; <BR>As for me, my little brain <BR>Isn't very bright; <BR>Choose for me, old Santa Claus, <BR>What you think is right. <BR>
