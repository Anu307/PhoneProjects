    <H2>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus</H2>
<P><B>I</B> saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus <BR>Underneath the mistletoe last night. <BR>She didn't see me creep <BR>Down the stairs to have a peep; <BR>She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep. <BR>Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <BR>Underneath his beard so snowy white; <BR>Oh, what a laugh it would have been <BR>If Daddy had only seen <BR>Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night. <BR>
