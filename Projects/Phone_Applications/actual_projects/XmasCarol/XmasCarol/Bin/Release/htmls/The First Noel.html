<H2>The First Noel</H2>
<P><B>T</B>he first Noel the angel did say <BR>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay; <BR>In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep, <BR>On a cold winter's night that was so deep. <BR><I>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,</I> <BR><I>Born is the King of Israel.</I> 
<P><B>T</B>hey looked up and saw a star <BR>Shining in the east beyond them far, <BR>And to the earth it gave great light, <BR>And so it continued both day and night. <I>Refrain</I> 
<P><B>A</B>nd by the light of that same star <BR>Three wise men came from country far; <BR>To seek for a king was their intent, <BR>And to follow the star wherever it went. <I>Refrain</I> 
<P><B>T</B>his star drew nigh to the northwest, <BR>O'er Bethlehem it took it rest, <BR>And there it did both stop and stay <BR>Right over the place where Jesus lay. <I>Refrain</I> 
<P><B>T</B>hen entered in those wise men three <BR>Full reverently upon their knee, <BR>And offered there in his presence <BR>Their gold, and myrrh, and frakincense. <I>Refrain</I> 
<P><B>T</B>hen let us all with one accord <BR>Sing praises to our heavenly Lord; <BR>That hath made heaven and earth of naught, <BR>And with his blood mankind hath bought. <I>Refrain</I> <BR>
