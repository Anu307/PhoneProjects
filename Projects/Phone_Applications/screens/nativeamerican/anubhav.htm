style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>How Glooskap Made the
Birds</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time long
before the white men came to Canada there lived a wicked giant who caused great
trouble and sorrow wherever he went. Men called him Wolf-Wind. Where he was
born no man knows, but his home was in the Cave of the Winds, far in the north
country in the Night-Night Land, and there men knew he was hiding on calm days
when the sun was hot and the sea was still, and on quiet nights when not a leaf
or a flower or a blade of grass was stirring. But whenever he appeared, the
great trees cracked in fear and the little trees trembled and the flowers bent
their heads close to the earth, trying to hide from his presence. Often he came
upon them without warning and with little sign of his coming. And then the corn
fell flat never to rise again, and tall trees crashed in the forest, and the
flowers dropped dead because of their terror; and often the great waters grew
white and moaned or screamed loudly or dashed themselves against the rocks
trying to escape from Wolf-Wind. And in the darkness of the night when
Wolf-Wind howled, there was great fear upon all the earth.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened once in
those old times that Wolf-Wind was in a great rage, and he went forth to kill
and devour all who dared to come in his path. It chanced in that time that many
Indian families were living near the sea. The men and women were fishing far
off the coast. They were catching fish to make food for the winter. They went
very far away in small canoes, for the sea had long been still and they thought
there was no danger. The little children were alone on shore. Suddenly as the
sun went down, without a sign of his coming, out of the north came Wolf-Wind in
his great rage looking for prey, and roaring loudly as he came. &quot;I am
Wolf-Wind, the giant,&quot; he howled, &quot;cross not my path, for I will kill
all the people I meet, and eat them all up.&quot; His anger only grew as he
stalked along, and he splashed and tossed the waters aside in his fury as he
came down upon the fishermen and fisher-women far out to sea. The fishers had
no time to get out of his reach or to paddle to the shore, so quick was
Wolf-Wind's coming, and the giant caught them in his path and broke up their
boats and killed them all. All night long he raged over the ocean looking for more
fishers.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the morning
Wolf-Wind's anger was not yet spent. Far away in front of him he saw the little
children of the fishers playing on the shore. He knew they were alone, for he
had killed their fathers and mothers. He resolved to catch them and kill them
too, and after them he went, still in a great rage. He went quickly towards the
land, roaring as he went and dashing the waters against the rocks in his
madness. As he came near the beach he howled in his anger, &quot;I will catch
you and kill you all and eat you and bleach your bones upon the sand.&quot; But
the children heard him and they ran away as fast as they could, and they hid in
a cave among the great rocks and placed a big stone at the mouth of the cave
and Wolf-Wind could not get in. He howled loudly at the door all day and all
night long, but the stone was strong and he could not break it down. Then he
went on his way still very angry and still roaring, and he howled, &quot;I will
come back and catch you yet. You cannot escape from me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The children were very
frightened and they stayed long in the cave after Wolf-Wind had gone, for far
away they could still hear him howling and crashing in the forest. Then they
came out. They knew that Wolf-Wind had killed their fathers and mothers on the
sea. They ran away into the forest, for they thought that there they would be
safe. They went to the Willow-Willow Land where they found a pleasant place
with grass and flowers and streams. And between them and the north country
where Wolf-Wind lived were many great trees with thick leaves which they knew
would protect them from the giant.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But one day Wolf-Wind,
true to his promise, came again in a rage to find them. He came into the land
killing all he met in his path. But he could not catch the children, for the
trees with their thick leaves kept him away. They heard him howling in the
forest far distant. For many days in the late summer he tried to find them but
their home was close to the trees, and the great branches spread over them and
the thick leaves saved them, and only the sun from the south, coming from the
Summer-Flower country, could look in upon them. Try as he could with all his
might old Wolf-Wind could not harm them although he knew that they were there;
and they were always safe while they lived in the Willow-Willow Land.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Wolf-Wind was more angry
than ever because of his failure, for he liked to feed on his little children,
and rage knew no bounds. He swore that he would have vengeance on the trees. So
he came back again and he brought with him to aid him another giant from the
north country who had with him a strange and powerful charm, the Charm of the
Frost. And the two giants tried to kill the trees that had saved the little
children. But over many of the trees they had no power, for when they came, the
trees only laughed and merely swayed and creaked and said, &quot;You cannot
harm us; we are strong, for we came at first from the Night-Night Land in the
far north country, and over us the Charm of the Frost has no power.&quot; These
were the Spruce and the Fir, the Hemlock and the Pine and the Cedar. But on the
other trees Wolf-Wind had vengeance as he had vowed. One night when the harvest
moon was shining in the sky he came without warning, and with the help of the
giant bearing the Charm of the Frost he killed all the leaves that had kept him
from the children, and threw them to the ground. One after one the leaves came
off from the Beech and the Birch, the Oak and the Maple, the Alder and the
Willow. Some fell quickly, some fluttered slowly down, and some took a long
time in dying. But at last the trees stood bare and cold against the sky and
there was stillness and sadness in the forest. And Wolf-Wind laughed and played
in silence through the leafless branches with the giant from Night-Night Land.
And he said, &quot;Now I have overcome the leaves that kept me away, and now
when I please I can kill the children.&quot; But the children only moved closer
to the strong and sturdy trees that had come at first from the far north
country and over which the Charm of the Frost had no power, and Wolf-Wind could
not reach them and they were still for ever safe from the giants.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The children were very
sad when they saw what Wolf-Wind had done to their friends and protectors, the
trees. Summer had gone back to the Southland following as she always did the
Rainbow Road to her home in the Wilderness of Flowers. It was lonely now in the
forest and silent; there was not a whisper in the trees; there were no leaves,
for it was autumn and Wolf-Wind had killed them all.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last it came to that
time of year when Glooskap, who ruled upon the earth and was very great in
those days, gave his yearly gifts to little children. And he came into the land
on a sled drawn by his faithful dogs to find out for himself what the children
wished for. And the children all came to him each asking for a boon. Now
Glooskap had great power upon the earth in that old time. He could always do
what he willed. And the little children whom Wolf-Wind had tried to harm in his
rage came to Glooskap, the Magic Master of gifts, and they were all very sad
because the leaves had gone.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What do you
wish?&quot; said Glooskap. &quot;We wish nothing for ourselves,&quot; said the
children, &quot;but we ask that the leaves that were killed by Wolf-Wind
because they saved us from his rage be brought back to life and put back again
in their old home in the trees.&quot; Glooskap was silent for a long time and
he sat and thought as was his custom, and he smoked hard at his mighty pipe,
for he was a great smoker. Now in that time there were no little forest birds
upon the earth, for Glooskap had not yet brought them into being. There were
only the birds that dwelt near the sea and over whom Wolf-Wind had no
power—Sea-gull and Crane, Wild-duck and Loon, Kingfisher and Brant and Curlew.
These only laughed at the giant in his rage and screamed in mockery as they
flew from him and hid when he came, among the shallows or the rocks or the
thick grass in the marshes. And there were also the sturdy birds that dwelt
with men and worked for them, giving them eggs and food. These were Hen and
Goose and Duck and Wild Turkey. They gave men food, but they were not fair to
look upon; they waddled along and could not fly well and they made no sweet
music upon the earth, for their song was a quack and a cackle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Glooskap decided to
bring other birds into the world, not to give food but to bring happiness to
the children on the days when summer dwells in the land, with their pretty
feathers and their pleasant songs. So after he had smoked long in silence he
hit upon a plan. And he said to the children asking for their yearly gifts,
&quot;I cannot bring back to the trees the leaves that Wolf-Wind has killed and
stripped off, for it is now too late. But I will take the fallen leaves and
change them into little birds. And the birds shall never forget how they were
born. When autumn comes they shall go with summer far away to the Summer-Flower
Land, but in the spring-time they shall always come back and they shall live as
close as they can to the leaves from which they have sprung. And they shall nest,
most of them, in the trees under the leaves, and even those that nest in the
grass shall love the trees and linger in them. And they shall all be beautiful
in colour like the leaves that gave them birth; and they shall have power to
rest at times upon the air like a leaf fluttering; and the voice of the air and
the laughing waters shall be in their throats and they shall sing sweet songs
for little children. And I give the children charge over them to keep them from
harm just as the leaves which gave them birth have saved the little children
from the giants. And I will give the trees that Wolf-Wind has stripped power to
bring forth new leaves every spring-time so that when Summer comes back from
the Wilderness of Flowers the trees shall not be bare. And although Wolf-Wind
may strip them off when the Giant of the Frost comes with him from the
Night-Night Land they shall always be replaced in the spring-time. And I will
take away much of Wolf-Wind's power so that he can no longer harm little
children as wickedly as he has done before.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Glooskap waved his magic
wand as was his custom, and at once great flocks of little birds sprang from
the ground where the fallen leaves had lain. And they twittered and sang in a
great chorus and flew back to the trees. They were of beautiful colours like
the leaves that had given them birth. There were Robin Red-breasts and Thrushes
all brown and red, from the red and brown leaves of the Oak. And there were
Finches and Humming-birds all yellow and green and brown from the leaves of the
Alder and the Willow, and they glowed like willows in the sunlight and
fluttered like a leaf upon the air. There were Yellowbirds and Canadian
Warblers from the golden Beech and Birch leaves. And there were Scarlet
Tanagers and Orioles and Grosbeaks all of changing colours, red and purple and
brown, from the leaves of the Canadian Maple. And they all sang to the children
and the children were all very happy again.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Glooskap sent the
little birds all away to a warm country until the rule of the Giant of the
Frost from the Night-Night Land was over, for it was winter in all the land and
it was very cold. But in the spring-time the little birds always come back from
the Summer-Flower Land. And they build their nests among the trees as close as
they can to their kindred, the leaves from which they came. And all day long
they sing among the leaves for little children. At day-break they wake the
children with their choir of dawn, and at twilight they lisp and twitter to
lull the children to sleep. And at night they hide among the leaves from
Wolf-Wind and are very still with never a twitter or a song. For they do not
forget that they are the children's gift from Glooskap and that they came from
the leaves stripped from the trees by Wolf-Wind because the leaves saved the
little children from the giant long ago.</span></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rabbit and the Grain
Buyers</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once long ago when the
Indians lived in Canada before the white men came, Rabbit was very lazy. He had
worked long for Glooskap, the great ruler of the people, as a forest guide, but
his toil was not appreciated or rewarded. He saw all the other animals idling
their time away, taking their ease all day long, and doing nothing but filling
their bellies with food, and sleeping all the afternoon in the hot sunshine.
And he said, &quot;Why should I work for other people when nobody works for me?
I will take mine ease like all the other animals.&quot; So he sulked in his
little house for a long time and could not be coaxed or driven to do any work.
But as he was a lonely fellow who always lived by himself with very few friends
in the world except little children, he soon got tired of this lazy life. For
by nature he was industrious and energetic and he always liked to be doing
something or prowling alone in the forest. So he said, &quot;I must find some
work to do or I shall surely lose my wits. But it must be labour that brings
profit to myself and not to other people.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For a long time Rabbit
puzzled his brains thinking on a business or a profession to follow. But
nothing seemed to be to his liking. At last one day he saw some Indians trading
skins and knives. One was selling and others were buying and they seemed to be
making a great deal of money without doing very much work. Rabbit thought that
here indeed was an easy way to make a living. Then he saw Duck coming along
carrying a basket of eggs. He said to Duck, &quot;How do you get along in the
world? You seem to do nothing but eat and cackle and swim in the pond. You
never seem to work.&quot; And Duck said, &quot;I lay eggs and sell them in
exchange for corn. Why don't you lay eggs? It is all very easy.&quot; But
Rabbit knew that Duck was only laughing at him, and that he was not meant to
make a living in that way.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he met Bee on the
forest path and he said, &quot;How do you make a living, you wandering bee? You
do nothing but gad about all day long, going from flower to flower dressed in
your good clothes of yellow and black and always singing your tuneless
song?&quot; And Bee said, &quot;I make honey and wax and sell them. I have a
great store for sale now. Why don't you do as I do? I am always happy. I always
sing at my work, and what's more, my song is not tuneless. And just for your
impudence, take that.&quot; And so saying he stung Rabbit on the nose and went
on his way, singing his droning song. Rabbit rubbed his nose in the earth to
ease his pain and he swore vengeance on Bee, for he knew that Bee too was only
laughing at him. But he could think of no way to make an easy living, for he
had nothing to sell but his coat, and he could not very well barter that, for
winter would soon be coming on. He was very angry and troubled and he envied
Duck and Bee their good fortune because of their eggs and honey and wax.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last he thought of
the Indians he had watched buying and selling skins. &quot;I have it,&quot; he
cried, &quot;I have it. I will become a great merchant. I will be a great
trader. I will live on a farm where they grow corn and vegetables, and I will
steal them and sell them to the other animals and thereby make a great store of
money. I shall be very rich in a short time.&quot; So, very happy, he went to a
field near which was a vegetable garden. And in it were growing Indian corn and
all kinds of grain which he knew the other birds and animals would gladly buy.
So he made a sign and put it up in front of his house, and it said, &quot;Buy
Rabbit's corn, the best in all the land; it will grow without rain; there is
only a small quantity left. Orders taken here.&quot; Then he sat in his house
and waited.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon many buyers began
to arrive. They were curious, and they wanted to see what kind of a merchant
Rabbit would make. Rabbit explained to them that he was only an agent, that
they must pay him their money, and he would take it to the farmer, and deliver
their grain at his house one week from that day. The buyers paid him the money
and went away, for they were afraid the farmer would kill them if they went
themselves for the corn. They left a great store of money with Rabbit. That
night when the moon rose over the hills Rabbit went to the field of corn
near-by. But the farmer had spied him thieving that afternoon, and he had
placed around his corn a fence of strong netting which poor Rabbit could not
get through. And he had also placed around the field many watch-dogs which
growled and snarled and frightened thieves away. Night after night Rabbit tried
to slip into the field, but without success, and the week passed and still he
had no corn for the customers who, he knew, would soon be arriving for their
goods. And meanwhile he had spent all their money and he knew they would all
fall upon him and kill him if he failed to keep his word and deliver their
purchases.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last when the day
agreed on arrived, he saw his customers coming for their grain. And he hoped
that his tricks would save him as they had saved him many times before. He sat
in his yard playing his flute, when Earth-Worm, the first customer arrived.
&quot;Good day,&quot; said Rabbit. &quot;Good day,&quot; said Earth-Worm,
&quot;I have come for my corn, for a week has gone by.&quot; &quot;Very
good,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;but first we shall have dinner. It will be ready
in a few minutes. You must be hungry after your long journey.&quot; As they sat
waiting for their dinner they saw Duck, another customer, waddling up the path
with her basket on her neck. And Rabbit said, &quot;Will not old Duck who comes
here want to eat you up?&quot; And Earth-Worm said, &quot;Yes, yes, where shall
I hide?&quot; and he was much excited. &quot;Hide under this clam-shell,&quot;
said Rabbit. So Earth-Worm crawled under the clam-shell and sat very still,
trembling for his life.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Duck arrived,
Rabbit said, &quot;Good morning.&quot; &quot;Good morning, Mr. Merchant,&quot;
said Duck, wishing to be polite. &quot;I have come for my corn, for it is the
appointed day of delivery.&quot; &quot;True, true,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;but
first we shall have dinner. It will be ready in a few minutes. It will be an honour
for me to have you dine with me.&quot; As they sat waiting for their dinner,
Rabbit said, &quot;Would you care to eat an Earth-Worm before your dinner? It
would be a good appetizer for you.&quot; And Duck said, &quot;Thank you very
much. I am very fond of Earth-Worms.&quot; Rabbit lifted the clam-shell and
poor Earth-Worm was quickly gobbled up by Duck. And Rabbit, laughing to
himself, thought, &quot;Now I am getting rid of my customers.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As Rabbit and Duck sat
talking, they saw Fox trotting up the path. He was another customer coming for
his corn. And Rabbit said courteously, &quot;Madam, I see your old enemy Fox
approaching. He will probably wish to eat you up; you had better hide.&quot;
And Duck with her feathers all ruffled with excitement said, &quot;Yes, yes,
where shall I hide?&quot; And Rabbit said, &quot;Hide under this basket.&quot;
So Duck crawled under the over-turned basket and sat very still.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Fox soon came in and
said, &quot;Good day, Rabbit. I have come for my corn, for I am in sore need of
it to catch chickens, and the seven days have passed.&quot; &quot;You are very
punctual,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;but first let us have dinner. It will be
ready in a few minutes. It will make you stronger to carry your heavy
load.&quot; As they sat waiting for their dinner, Rabbit said, &quot;Listen,
Fox. Would you care to eat a fat Duck now? It would be a tasty bit for you
before you dine.&quot; And Fox said, &quot;You are very kind. I always like to
eat a Duck before my dinner.&quot; Rabbit knocked over the basket and Fox
quickly devoured poor Duck until not a feather remained. And Rabbit laughed to
himself and said, &quot;Surely I am getting rid of my customers very
easily.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As Rabbit and Fox sat
talking over old times in the forest, they saw Bear coming lumbering up the
path, tossing his head from side to side, and sniffing the air. And Rabbit
said, &quot;Bear is in a bad temper to-day. I wonder what can be the
cause.&quot; And Fox said, &quot;This morning I stole all his honey and he saw
me running away.&quot; &quot;He scents you here,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;will
he not kill you if he finds you? Perhaps you ought to hide.&quot; &quot;Yes,
yes,&quot; said Fox, &quot;but where shall I hide?&quot; &quot;Hide in this
box,&quot; said Rabbit, and Fox sprang into the box, and Rabbit closed down the
lid.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Bear arrived he
said gruffly, for he was in a bad temper, &quot;Good day, Rabbit. I have come
for my corn and I must have it quickly, for I must be on my way. It is the
appointed time.&quot; &quot;It is indeed the appointed time,&quot; said Rabbit,
&quot;but first we shall have dinner. It will be ready in a few minutes and I
never let a wayfarer leave my house without first taking nourishment. I have
to-day a dish of fresh fish which you like very well, and we have never yet
dined together.&quot; And Bear agreed to wait and his gruffness left him at the
thought of his good meal, for he was a great fish-eater, and he talked
pleasantly. Then Rabbit said, &quot;I have a secret to tell you. Let me whisper
it.&quot; He put his mouth close to Bear's ear and said, &quot;Old Fox, the sly
thief who stole all your honey this morning is hiding in the box by your side.
He came here to boast about his theft and he laughed loudly to me as he told me
how easily you were cheated. He called you Lack-Brains.&quot; Bear was very
angry and at once he knocked the lid from the box and killed Fox with one blow
of his powerful paw. And Rabbit said to himself, &quot;What luck I am having;
there is another of my customers gone.&quot; But he wondered how he was to get
rid of Bear, and he scratched his head in thought.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While Bear and Rabbit
sat talking, they saw Rabbit's last customer, the Hunter, coming along. Bear
would have run away, but it was too late. &quot;Will the Hunter not want to
kill you?&quot; said Rabbit, glad to think that here was the end of poor Bear.
&quot;Indeed he will,&quot; said Bear. &quot;Oh dear, oh dear, where shall I
hide?&quot; &quot;Hide under my bed in my house,&quot; said Rabbit. Poor Bear
quickly dashed into the house and crawled under Rabbit's bed with great
difficulty for he was very fat and the bed was very low and he had to lay
himself out flat on the floor, but he was comfortable in the thought that he
would soon escape. When Hunter arrived he said, &quot;Good day, Rabbit, I have
come for my corn, for my children need bread.&quot; &quot;You shall have
it,&quot; said Rabbit. &quot;But first we must have a bite to eat. I have not
very much to offer you, but I can give you in a few minutes some hot pancakes
and fresh maple syrup.&quot; The Hunter was well pleased with the thought of
such a good meal and he said he would be glad to wait. Then Rabbit said,
&quot;Would you like some bear meat for your children, and a good warm bear
skin for your hearth?&quot; And the Hunter said, &quot;Indeed I would. But in
these days such luxuries are hard to find.&quot; And Rabbit said, &quot;Oh no,
they are not; under my bed in my house, a good fat bear is hiding. He is lying
flat on his back, and you can easily kill him.&quot; The Hunter hurried to the
house, and sure enough there he found Bear hiding under the bed, flat upon his
back. He killed him with a blow and skinned him and cut him up into small
pieces and put the meat and the skin into a bag to take home to his children.
But while he was about it, Rabbit slipped away into the forest, saying to
himself, &quot;Now I have got rid of all my customers and I am safe. But the
life of a merchant is not to my liking. I will not be a trader any more. I will
gather corn for myself, but not to sell to others.&quot; And he ran quickly
away and hid himself in a dense thicket.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Hunter went to
look for Rabbit, he could not find him, nor was he able to find his grain. And
although he thought he had fared pretty well by getting so much bear meat, he
swore vengeance on Rabbit for his deceit, and to this day he searches for him,
and if he meets him, he will not let him escape. And Rabbit lives by himself
and keeps away from the Hunter as far as he can, for he fears him because of
the trick he played upon him in the olden days.</span></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Saint Nicholas and the
Children</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Two little children
lived with their old grandmother in a remote place in the Canadian forest. They
were twin children—a boy and a girl, Pierre and Estelle by name—and except for
their dress it was not easy to tell them apart. Their father and mother had
died in the spring-time, and in the summer they had left their old home because
of its many sad memories and had gone to live with their old grandmother in a
new home elsewhere. In this new home in the forest where they now lived they
were very poor, but they were not unhappy. Times were hard, and there was very
little food to be had no matter how well their old grandmother worked; but they
caught fish in the streams and gathered berries and fruit and birds' eggs on
the wooded hills, and somehow throughout the summer they kept themselves from
want. But when late autumn came and the streams were frozen over and the
berries were all gone and there were no eggs, for the birds had all flown
south, they were often hungry because they had so little to eat.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Their grandmother worked
so hard to provide for herself and the children that at last she fell very
sick. For several days she could not leave her bed. And she said, &quot;I want
meat broth to make me well and I must have good meat to make it. If I do not
get meat I can have no broth, and if I do not get broth I shall not get well,
and if I do not get well I shall die, and if I die you two children will surely
starve and die too. So meat and meat alone can save us all from starvation and
death.&quot; So the two children, to keep themselves and their grandmother
alive, set out one morning in search of meat to make the broth. They lived far
from other people and they did not know where to go, but they followed the
forest path. The snow lay deep on the ground and sparkled brightly in the
sunlight. The children had never before been away from home alone and every
sight was of great interest to them. Here and there a rabbit hopped over the
snow, or a snowbird hovered and twittered overhead, all looking for food like
the children. And there were holly-berries growing in many places, and there
was mistletoe hanging from the trees. And Pierre when he saw the holly-berries
and the mistletoe said, &quot;Saint Nicholas will be soon here, for the trees
are dressed and ready for his coming.&quot; And Estelle said, &quot;Yes, Saint
Nicholas will be soon here.&quot; And they were both very glad thinking of his
coming.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As they went along in
the afternoon, they came upon an old man sitting at the door of a small house
of spruce-boughs under the trees close to the forest path. He was busy making
whistles, whittling willow wands with a knife and tapping gently on the bark
until the bark loosened from the wood and slipped easily off. The children
stood and watched him at his strange work, for he had merry twinkling eyes, and
a kindly weather-beaten face, and thick white hair, and they were not afraid.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hello,&quot; said
the old man.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hello,&quot; said
Pierre, &quot;why are you making willow whistles?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am making them
for Saint Nicholas,&quot; said the old man; &quot;he is coming soon for his
yearly visit; indeed he is already in the land; when he makes his rounds he
always gives whistles, among other things, to good children, and I must have a
great store of them ready for him when he comes, for there are many children to
supply.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he went on
whittling busily with his knife. The children watched him for a long time in
silence, and they thought what a fine thing it must be to work like the old man
for Saint Nicholas, in his little house of boughs under the forest trees. Then
the old man said, &quot;You are very small children; what are you seeking so
far away from people?&quot; And Estelle answered, &quot;Our old grandmother is
very sick, and we are looking for meat to make broth to make her well.&quot; The
old man was sorry he had no meat, for he lived on other food. He told them that
some distance farther along there was a butcher who always kept meat; but the
butcher, he said, was a very wicked fellow and sometimes little children who
entered his shop never came out again. The children were very frightened when
they heard what the old man said and they wondered if they had better go back
home. But the old man thought for a long time in silence as he whittled his
willow wands, and then he said, &quot;I will give you each a whistle, and when
you blow it, Saint Nicholas will always hear it; you must never blow it except
when you are in great trouble or distress, and when Saint Nicholas hears it he
will know that you are coming to grief or that harm is already upon you and he
will come himself or send some one to your assistance. But you must blow only
one blast. The whistle should be given only by Saint Nicholas himself when he
comes at holly-time into the land. But you are good children and your old
grandmother is sick, and you are trying to make her well, and I know that Saint
Nicholas will not say that I have done wrong.&quot; So he gave the children
each a whistle, and then fear left them, for they knew they could now come to
no harm if they had the aid of Saint Nicholas.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was growing late in
the afternoon and the children set out on their way to find the wicked butcher.
But they had many misgivings, and as they went on they grew faint of heart, for
they wondered if the old man had told them the truth about the whistles or if
he was in reality a secret agent of the wicked butcher trying to lure them to
their death. They resolved to search for meat elsewhere and to keep away from
the butcher's shop.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For a long time they
searched, but without success. There was no meat to be had in all the land at
any of the places they stopped to ask. Soon they came in sight of the butcher's
shop. They were very frightened. But the sun had already gone down behind the
trees, and night was coming on, and they had still no meat. And they knew that
if their old grandmother was to get well she must have meat to make broth. The
shop, too, looked very pleasant and attractive in the cold winter evening. Warm
light was shining from a fire through the door, and in the windows were
sausages, and fat birds, and big yellow pumpkins and cakes with red berries on
the top. The children were hungry and wished for something to eat by the warm
shop fire. They decided to enter the shop notwithstanding their fear, to buy
some food, and to get meat for their grandmother's broth as quickly as they
could. But before they entered the shop they thought it would be well, in order
to be safe, to blow a blast on their whistle as the old man had told them so
that Saint Nicholas would know that they were in dread of harm. They stood for
a time in the shadow of the great trees before the door and made ready to blow
together. Pierre gave the signal and blew a long soft blast. But Estelle could
not get her whistle from her pocket and Pierre had finished his blast, all out
of breath, before she was ready to blow. &quot;Don't blow now,&quot; he said,
&quot;you are just like a girl, always too late.&quot; But blow she would, as
the old man had told her, and before Pierre could stop her she blew a long soft
blast on her whistle. Pierre was very cross, for he thought that now no good
could come of it, as two blasts had sounded, but with his sister he entered the
butcher's shop.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The wicked butcher was
in his shop, but not another person was about the place. It was all very quiet.
The man was very glad to see the children and he seated them by the warm fire,
and gave them food, and although he shut the door tight behind them, their fear
soon vanished. After they had eaten well and were warm again, they asked for
meat to make broth for their old grandmother, and the butcher said he would
give them plenty of good meat although it was very scarce in all the land.
There was a barrel standing in one corner; in another corner was a large
hogshead reaching almost to the ceiling, and the butcher said that both of
these were full of meat.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the butcher was
really the friend and partner of a wicked giant who lived in the forest. The
giant's greatest delight was to eat little children. He liked no meal so well
as a meal of little children, two at a time, pickled first in brine. He ate
them always when he could get them, but he was not always successful in his
search, for children were scarce in the land. He was a great hunter and he was
able to kill many animals in the forest and to secure much meat, so great was
his strength, and once a week regularly he brought a great load of meat to the
butcher and traded it for any little children the butcher managed to entice
into his shop. So the butcher got much meat at little cost. And the old man of
the house of boughs was right when he said that many little children who
entered the shop never came out again.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The butcher was very
glad when he saw the two pretty little children. He was expecting the giant
that evening on his weekly visit, and he thought gleefully of the great load of
meat he would get from the giant in exchange for the children, for he would ask
a big price, and he knew the giant would give all the meat he had for so good a
meal. And he thought too of all the money he would get for the giant's load of
meat. So he resolved to kill the children and pickle them in brine to await the
giant's coming.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the children had
finished their meal and had warmed themselves by the fire they made ready to go
home and they asked for their meat. The butcher said he would get it for them.
They looked up at the shelves, laden with more food than they had ever seen
before—hams and cabbages and strings of onions. And the little children said,
&quot;There are good onions up there; we will buy some and take them home to
our grandmother to put in her broth.&quot; The butcher said, &quot;There are
many kinds of onions in the box on the high shelf. You must pick out the kind
you want. I will lift you up to the shelf so that you can see for
yourselves.&quot; So he caught them each by the coat between the shoulders, and
because of his great strength he lifted them high until they could look into
the box and pick out the onions they wanted. As he took them down he thrust
them straight out from his body at arm's length and held them there and they
laughed because of his great strength. Then he brought them together with
terrible force so that their heads struck one against the other and they were
stunned by the cruel blow. Then he threw them head first into the barrel in the
corner which was filled with brine, not with meat as he had said, and he left
them there to pickle well. He was greatly pleased with the fine load of meat he
would get in exchange from the giant, who, he knew, would appear before many
minutes had passed.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon the giant arrived.
He carried on his back a great load of meat and he also drew a sled heavily
laden with many dressed carcasses of animals he had killed. &quot;What cheer
for me to-night and what fortune?&quot; he said to the butcher as he entered
the warm shop with his load. And the butcher said, &quot;Good cheer and fine
fortune. I have a good fat pair for you to-night already pickling in the
brine.&quot; Then he uncovered the barrel in the corner and showed the giant
the two little children sticking head first in the pickle. The giant smacked
his fat lips and chuckled and rubbed his great hands, so pleased was he with
the sight of so good a meal. And he said, &quot;We will let them steep well in
the brine until to-morrow. I always like them very salt.&quot; They covered up
the barrel, and then they bargained about the purchase of the meat.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The giant agreed to give
the butcher all his meat in exchange for the children. Then they sat by the
fire drinking and eating until far on into the night. And the giant said that
before they went to bed he would take another look at the children to see how
they were pickling. So they went and uncovered the barrel.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it chanced that
Saint Nicholas was in the land at that time, as the old man of the
House-of-boughs had said. He had come into the land to bring his yearly gifts
to little children. In the evening he was many miles away from the butcher's
shop. But he heard the long soft blast of a whistle, borne on the still evening
wind. He knew it to be one of his own whistles, and it told him that little
children were in danger. But it was followed by another soft blast—the late
blast of Estelle's whistle—and the two blasts meant that the danger was not yet
very near to the children, that indeed it was far off, so he thought that there
was no need to hurry to the children's aid. Moreover, Saint Nicholas was just
then leaving tiny dolls for little babies in many little houses in the forest
and he decided to take his time and finish the giving of all these gifts before
he set out to the place from which the whistle-blast had come.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last he was able to go
on his way. The snow lay deep in the forest, and travelling was hard, but the
white winter moon was shining, and the path was bright and Saint Nicholas moved
along quickly on his snow-shoes. Far on in the night he reached the butcher's
shop from which he knew the children's note of fear had come. As he entered the
shop, the giant and the butcher were just taking their last look before going
to bed at the children sticking in the barrel of brine. They did not know Saint
Nicholas, but when they saw him they quickly placed the cover on the barrel and
were very much confused. Saint Nicholas was suspicious that they were about
some wickedness, and he knew well that in some way or other the barrel was
connected with the dreaded harm of which the children's whistle had told him,
and he thought that perhaps the children were hidden in it. So he said, &quot;I
have come for meat. I want meat that has been pickled in brine. I should like a
piece from that barrel.&quot; But the butcher said, &quot;It is not good meat.
I have better meat in the inner room, and I will get it for you.&quot; So the
butcher and Saint Nicholas entered the inner room and closed the door behind
them while the giant sat on the barrel in the corner, trying to hide it with
his great fat legs.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the inner room was a barrel
filled with brine, but with only a small piece of meat at the bottom. Saint
Nicholas said he would take that piece. The butcher bent far into the barrel to
reach down in search of the meat. But as he did so, Saint Nicholas picked him
up by the legs and pushed him head first into the barrel of brine. He
spluttered and kicked, but he stuck fast in the barrel, and could not get out.
Saint Nicholas placed the cover on the barrel, with a great weight on top of
it, and that was the end of the wicked butcher. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Saint Nicholas
returned to the shop where the giant was waiting, still sitting on the barrel.
He told the giant that he wanted a piece of meat that lay in the bottom of the
large hogshead of pickle in the other corner. He asked the giant to get it for
him, as the hogshead was so high that neither he nor the butcher could reach
down into it.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The giant bent far into
the hogshead and began groping for the meat at the bottom. Saint Nicholas took
a large bone that lay on the floor, and standing on a box beside the hogshead
he struck the giant a powerful blow on the head. The giant was only slightly
stunned, but in his surprise he lost his balance, and fell head first into the
brine. He yelled and kicked for a time, but his huge shoulders stuck fast.
Saint Nicholas covered the hogshead, leaving the giant sticking fast in the
pickle, and that was the end of the giant.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Saint Nicholas
uncovered the barrel in the corner into which he had seen the butcher and the
giant looking when he had first entered the shop. There were the two children
standing on their heads in the pickle with their feet sticking out at the top.
He caught them by the legs and pulled them out and by his magic power he soon
brought them back to life. He gave them food and warmed them by the fire and
soon they were none the worse for their hour in the barrel of brine.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he gave them meat
and brought them back to their grandmother. And they made broth for her and
soon made her well, and they were all happy again. And the land was troubled no
more by giants, for Saint Nicholas never again allowed great harm to come to
little children if they always kept his whistle near them and blew softly upon
it when they were in trouble or distress.</span></p>

style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Fall of the Spider
Man</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In olden times the
Spider Man lived in the sky-country. He dwelt in a bright little house all by
himself, where he weaved webs and long flimsy ladders by which people went back
and forth from the sky to the earth. The Star-people often went at night to
earth where they roamed about as fairies of light, doing good deeds for women
and little children, and they always went back and forth on the ladder of the
Spider Man. The Spider Man had to work very hard, weaving his webs, and
spinning the yarn from which his ladders were made. One day when he had a short
breathing-time from his toil he looked down at the earth-country and there he
saw many of the earth-people playing at games, or taking sweet sap from the
maple trees, or gathering berries on the rolling hills; but most of the men
were lazily idling and doing nothing. The women were all working, after the
fashion of Indians in those days; the men were working but little. And Spider
Man said to himself, &quot;I should like to go to the earth-country where men
idle their time away. I would marry four wives who would work for me while I
would take life easy, for I need a rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was very tired of his
work for he was kept at it day and night always spinning and weaving his webs.
But when he asked for a rest he was not allowed to stop; he was only kicked for
his pains and called Sleepy Head, and Lazy-bones and other harsh names, and
told to work harder. Then he grew angry and he resolved to punish the
Star-people because they kept him so hard at work. He thought that if he
punished them and made himself a nuisance, they would be glad to be rid of him.
So he hit upon a crafty plan. Each night when a Star-fairy was climbing back to
the sky-country, just as he came near the top of the ladder, the Spider Man
would cut the strands and the fairy would fall to earth with a great crash.
Night after night he did this, and he chuckled to himself as he saw the
sky-fairies sprawling through the air and kicking their heels, while the
earth-people looked up wonderingly at them and called them Shooting Stars. Many
Star-people fell to earth in this way because of the Spider Man's tricks, and
they could never get back to the sky-country because of their broken limbs or
their disfigured faces, for in the sky-country the people all must have beautiful
faces and forms. But Spider Man's tricks brought him no good; the people would
not drive him away because they needed his webs and he was kept always at his
tasks. At last he decided to run away of his own accord, and, one night when
the Moon and the Stars had gone to work and the Sun was asleep, he said
farewell to the sky-country and let himself down to earth by one of his own
strands of yarn, spinning it as he dropped down.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the earth-country he
married four wives as he had planned, for he wanted them to work for him while
he took his ease. He thought he had worked long enough. All went well for a
time and the Spider Man was quite happy living his lazy and contented life. Not
a strand did he spin, nor a web did he weave. No men on earth were working;
only the women toiled. At last, Glooskap, who ruled upon the earth in that
time, became very angry because the men in these parts were so lazy, and he
sent Famine into their country to punish them for their sins. Famine came very
stealthily into the land and gathered up all the corn and carried it off; then
he called to him all the animals, and the birds, and the fish of the sea and
river, and he took them away with him. In all the land there was nothing left
to eat. Only water remained. The people were very hungry and they lived on
water for many days. Sometimes they drank the water cold, sometimes hot,
sometimes luke-warm, but at best it was but poor fare. The Spider Man soon grew
tired of this strange diet, for it did not satisfy his hunger to live always on
water. It filled his belly and swelled him to a great size, but it brought him
little nourishment or strength. So he said, &quot;There must be good food
somewhere in the world; I will go in search of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That night when all the
world was asleep he took a large bag, and crept softly away from his four wives
and set out on his quest for food. He did not want any one to know where he was
going. For several days he travelled, living only on water; but he found no
food, and the bag was still empty on his back. At last one day he saw birds in
the trees and he knew that he was near the border of the Hunger-Land. That
night in the forest when he stopped at a stream to drink, he saw a tiny gleam
of light far ahead of him through the trees. He hurried towards the light and
soon he came upon a man with a great hump on his shoulders and scars on his
face, and a light hanging at his back, with a shade on it which he could close
and open at his will. The Spider Man said, &quot;I am looking for food; tell me
where I can find it.&quot; And the humped man with the light said, &quot;Do you
want it for your people?&quot; But the Spider Man said, &quot;No, I want it for
myself.&quot; Then the humped man laughed and said, &quot;You are near to the
border of the Land of Plenty; follow me and I will give you food.&quot; Then he
flashed the light at his back, opening and closing the shade so that the light
flickered, and he set off quickly through the trees. The Spider Man followed
the light flashing in the darkness, but he had to go so fast that he was almost
out of breath when he reached the house where the humped man had stopped. But
the humped man only laughed when he saw the Spider Man coming puffing wearily
along with his fat and swollen belly. He gave him a good fat meal and the
Spider Man soon felt better after his long fast. Then the humped man said,
&quot;You are the Spider Man who once weaved webs in the sky. I, too, once
dwelt in the star-country, and one dark night as I was climbing back from the
earth-country on your ladder, carrying my lamp on my back to light the way,
when I was near the sky you cut the strands of the web and I fell to the earth
with a great crash. That is why I have a great hump on my back and scars on my
face, and because of this I have never been allowed to go back to the
sky-country of the stars. I roam the earth at nights as a forest fairy just as
I did in the olden days, for I have my former power still with me, and I still
carry my lamp at my back; it is the starlight from the sky-country. I shall
never get back to the star-country while I have life. But some day when my work
on earth is done I shall go back. But although you were cruel to me I will give
you food.&quot; The Spider Man remembered the nights he had cut the ladder
strands, and he laughed to himself at the memory of the star-fairies falling to
earth with a great crash. But the man with the light knew that now he had his
chance to take vengeance on the Spider Man. The latter did not suspect evil. He
was glad to get food at last.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the humped man
said, &quot;I will give you four pots. You must not open them until you get
home. They will then be filled with food, and thereafter always when you open
them they will be packed with good food. And the food will never grow
less.&quot; The Spider Man put the four pots in his bag and slinging it over
his shoulder he set out for his home, well pleased with his success. After he
had gone away, the humped man used his power to make him hungry. Yet for
several days he travelled without opening the pots, for although he was almost
starving he wished to do as the humped man had told him. At last he could wait
no longer. He stopped near his home, took the pots out of the bag and opened
them. They were filled with good food as he had been promised. In one was a
fine meat stew; in another were many cooked vegetables; in another was bread
made from Indian corn; and in another was luscious ripe fruit. He ate until he
was full. He covered the pots, put them back in the bag, and hid the bag among
the trees. Then he went home. He had meanwhile taken pity on his people and he
decided to invite the Chief and all the tribe to a feast the next evening, for
the pots would be full, and the food would never decrease, and there would be
enough for all. He thought the people would regard him as a very wonderful man
if he could supply them all with good food in their hunger.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he reached his home
his wives were very glad to see him back, and they at once brought him water,
the only food they had. But he laughed them to scorn, and threw the water in
their faces and said, &quot;Oh, foolish women, I do not want water; it is not
food for a great man like me. I have had a good meal of meat stew and corn
bread and cooked vegetables and luscious ripe fruit. I know where much food is
to be found, but I alone know. I can find food when all others fail, for I am a
great man. Go forth and invite the Chief and all the people to a feast which I
shall provide for them to-morrow night—a feast for all the land, for my food
never grows less.&quot; They were all amazed when they heard his story, and the
thought of his good meal greatly added to their hunger. But they went out and
summoned all the tribe to a feast as he had told them.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next night all the
people gathered for the feast, for the news of it had spread through all the
land. They had taken no water that day, for they wished to eat well, and they
were very hungry. They were as hungry as wild beasts in search of food. The
Spider Man was very glad because the people praised him, and he proudly brought
in his bag of pots. The people all waited hungrily and eagerly. But when he
uncovered the first pot there was no food there; he uncovered the second pot,
but there was no food there; he uncovered all the pots, but not a bit of food
was in any of them. They were all empty, and in the bottom of each was a great
gaping hole. Now it had happened in this way. When the humped man, the
Star-fairy, had given the pots to the Spider Man, he knew well that the Spider
Man would disobey his orders and that he would open the pots before he reached
his home. He chuckled to himself, for he knew that now he could take vengeance
on the web-weaver who had injured him. So when the Spider Man had left the pots
among the trees, the humped man used his magic power and made holes in the
pots, and the charm of the food was broken and all the food disappeared. When
the people saw the empty pots they thought they had been purposely deceived.
The remains of the food and the smell of stew and of fruit still clung to the
pots. They thought the Spider Man had eaten all the food himself. So in their
great hunger and their rage and their disappointment they fell upon him and
beat him and bore him to the ground, while the humped man with the lamp at his
back hiding behind the trees looked on and laughed in his glee. Then the people
split the Spider Man's arms to the shoulders, and his legs to the thighs, so
that he had eight limbs instead of four. And the humped man—the star-fairy
named Fire-fly—came forth from behind the trees and standing over the fallen
Spider Man he said, &quot;Henceforth because of your cruelty to the star-people
you will always crawl on eight legs, and you will have a fat round belly
because of the water you have drunk; and sometimes you will live on top of the
water. But you shall always eat only flies and insects. And you will always
spin downwards but never upwards, and you will often try to get back to the
star-country, but you shall always slip down again on the strand of yarn you
have spun.&quot; Then Fire-fly flashed his light and went quickly away, opening
and closing the shade of his lamp as he flitted among the trees. And to this
day the Spider Man lives as the humped man of the lamp had spoken, because of
the cruelty he practised on the star-fairies in the olden days.</span></p>

Thick-head</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Three brothers lived
with their old Indian mother in the forest near the sea. Their father had long
been dead. At his death he had little of the world's goods to his credit and
his widow and her sons were very poor. In the place where they dwelt, game was
not plentiful, and to get food enough to keep them from want they had often to
go far into the forest. The youngest boy was smaller and weaker than the
others, and when the two older sons went far away to hunt, they always left him
behind, for although he always wished to accompany them they would never allow
him to go. He had to do all the work about the house, and all day long he
gathered wood in the forest and carried water from the stream. And even when
his brothers went out in the spring-time to draw sap from the maple trees he
was never permitted to go with them. He was always making mistakes and doing
foolish things. His brothers called him Thick-head, and all the people round
about said he was a simpleton because of his slow and queer ways. His mother
alone was kind to him and she always said, &quot;They may laugh at you and call
you fool, but you will prove to be wiser than all of them yet, for so it was
told me by a forest fairy at your birth.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Chief of the people
had a beautiful daughter who had many suitors. But her father spurned them all
from his door and said, &quot;My daughter is not yet of age to marry; and when
her time of marriage comes, she will only marry the man who can make great
profit from hunting.&quot; The two older sons of the old woman decided that one
of them must win the girl. So they prepared to set out on a great hunting
expedition far away in the northern forest, for it was now autumn, and the
hunter's moon had come. The youngest boy wanted to go with them, for he had
never been away from home and he wished to see the world. And his mother said
he might go. His brothers were very angry when they heard his request, and they
said, &quot;Much good Thick-head can do us in the chase. He will only bring us
bad luck. He is not a hunter but a scullion and a drudge fit only for the
fireside.&quot; But his mother commanded them to grant the boy's wish and they
had to obey. So the three brothers set out for the north country, the two older
brothers grumbling loudly because they were accompanied by the boy they thought
a fool.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two older brothers
had good success in the chase and they killed many animals—deer and rabbits and
otters and beavers. And they came home bearing a great quantity of dried meat
and skins. They each thought, &quot;Now we have begun to prove our prowess to the
Chief, and if we succeed as well next year when the hunter's moon comes again,
one of us will surely win his daughter when she is old enough to marry.&quot;
But all the youngest boy brought home as a result of his journey into the game
country was a large Earth-Worm as thick as his finger and as long as his arm.
It was the biggest Earth-Worm he had ever seen. He thought it a great curiosity
as well as a great discovery, and he was so busy watching it each day that he
had no time to hunt. When he brought it home in a box, his brothers said to
their mother, &quot;What did we tell you about Thick-head? He has now surely
proved himself a fool. He has caught only a fat Earth-Worm in all these
weeks.&quot; And they noised it abroad in the village and all the people
laughed loudly at the simpleton, until &quot;Thick-head's hunt&quot; became a
by-word in all the land. But the boy's mother only smiled and said, &quot;He
will surprise them all yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy kept the
Earth-Worm in a tiny pen just outside the door of his home. One day a large
Duck came waddling along, and sticking her bill over the little fence of the
pen she quickly gobbled up the Worm. The boy was very angry and he went to the
man who owned the Duck, and said, &quot;Your Duck ate up my pet Worm. I want my
Worm.&quot; The man offered to pay him whatever price he asked, but the boy
said, &quot;I do not want your price. I want my Worm.&quot; But the man said,
&quot;How can I give you your Worm when my Duck has eaten it up? It is gone for
ever.&quot; And the boy said, &quot;It is not gone. It is in the Duck's belly.
So I must have the Duck.&quot; Then to avoid further trouble the man gave
Thick-head the Duck, for he thought to himself, &quot;What is the use of
arguing with a fool.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy took the Duck
home and kept it in a little pen near his home with a low fence around it. And
he tied a great weight to its foot so that it could not fly away. He was quite
happy again, for he thought, &quot;Now I have both my Worm and the Duck.&quot;
But one day a Fox came prowling along looking for food. He saw the fat Duck
tied by the foot in the little pen. And he said, &quot;What good fortune! There
is a choice meal for me,&quot; and in a twinkling he was over the fence. The
Duck quacked and made a great noise, but she was soon silenced. The Fox had
just finished eating up the Duck when the boy, who had heard the quacking, came
running out of the house. The Fox was smacking his lips after his good meal,
and he was too slow in getting away. The boy fell to beating him with a stout
club and soon killed him and threw his body into the yard behind the house. And
he thought, &quot;That is not so bad. Now I have my Worm and the Duck and the
Fox.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That night an old Wolf
came through the forest in search of food. He was very hungry, and in the
bright moonlight he saw the dead Fox lying in the yard. He pounced upon it
greedily and devoured it until not a trace of it was left. But the boy saw him
before he could get away, and he came stealthily upon him and killed him with a
blow of his axe. &quot;I am surely in good luck,&quot; he thought, &quot;for
now I have the Worm and the Duck and the Fox and the Wolf.&quot; But the next
day when he told his brothers of his good fortune and his great skill, they
laughed at him loudly and said, &quot;Much good a dead Wolf will do you. Before
two days have passed it will be but an evil-smelling thing and we shall have to
bury it deep. You are indeed a great fool.&quot; The boy pondered for a long
time over what they had said, and he thought, &quot;Perhaps they are right. The
dead Wolf cannot last long. I will save the skin.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he skinned the Wolf
and dried the skin and made a drum from it. For the drum was one of the few
musical instruments of the Indians in those old times, and they beat it loudly
at all their dances and festivals. The boy beat the drum each evening, and made
a great noise, and he was very proud because he had the only drum in the whole
village. One day the Chief sent for him and said to him, &quot;I want to borrow
your drum for this evening. I am having a great gathering to announce to all
the land that my daughter is now of age to marry and that suitors may now seek
her hand in marriage. But we have no musical instruments and I want your drum,
and I myself will beat it at the dance.&quot; So Thick-head brought his drum to
the Chief's house, but he was not very well pleased, because he was not invited
to the feast, while his brothers were among the favoured guests. And he said to
the Chief, &quot;Be very careful. Do not tear the skin of my drum, for I can
never get another like it. My Worm and my Duck and my Fox and my Wolf have all
helped to make it.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day he went for
his drum. But the Chief had struck it too hard and had split it open so that it
would now make no sound and it was ruined beyond repair. He offered to pay the
boy a great price for it, but the boy said, &quot;I do not want your price. I
want my drum. Give me back my drum, for my Worm and the Duck and the Fox and
the Wolf are all in it.&quot; The Chief said, &quot;How can I give you back
your drum when it is broken? It is gone for ever. I will give you anything you
desire in exchange for it. Since you do not like the price I offer, you may
name your own price and you shall have it.&quot; And the boy thought to
himself, &quot;Here is a chance for good fortune. Now I shall surprise my
brothers.&quot; And he said, &quot;Since you cannot give me my drum, I will
take your daughter in marriage in exchange.&quot; The Chief was much perplexed,
but he had to be true to his word. So he gave his daughter to Thick-head, and
they were married, and the girl brought him much treasure and they lived very
happily. And his brothers were much amazed and angered because they had failed.
But his mother said, &quot;I told you he was wiser than you and that he would
outwit you yet although you called him Thick-head and fool. For the forest
fairy said it to me at his birth.&quot;</span></p>

style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rabbit and the Indian
Chief</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Long ago an Indian Chief
was living with his people far in the Canadian forest. Life was good and food
was plentiful and the people were all very happy. But one day a wicked giant
and his old witch wife came crashing into the land from a far country beyond
the prairies. They devoured all the food they could lay their hands on and soon
there was little left to eat in all the country; and often they carried off
little children to their hiding-place and ate them up until not a trace of them
remained. Somewhere far in the forest they dwelt in a hidden cave; they slept
all day long, but at night they always stalked forth in search of plunder. The
Chief was much troubled, and with his warriors he tried in every way to
discover their hiding-place, but no one ever succeeded in finding it. For by
the use of their magic power the giant and his old witch wife could make
themselves invisible when they walked abroad among men and they could not be
caught. The Chief called all his warriors to a council, and he said, &quot;Who
can rid me of this pest? Who can kill the giant?&quot; But not a man replied.
And when he saw his people's store of food rapidly growing smaller and the
little children of his tribe slowly disappearing, he was greatly puzzled as to
what he should do.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One night of bright
moonlight Rabbit was prowling through the woods, as was his custom, in search
of some one on whom he could play a prank, for he was a great joker. Suddenly
he came upon the giant and his old witch wife standing by an opening in the
side of a low mountain. He watched them for a long time from the shadow of a
great tree, and at last he saw them enter a large hole in the side of the hill.
He knew now that he had hit by accident upon the giant's cave and he was well
pleased by his discovery. But he kept his secret to himself, for he thought,
&quot;Here is a good chance for me to win fame. I will kill the giants by a
crafty trick and I will then be looked upon as a great warrior, the foremost in
all the land, for all the Chief's men have failed to find the giants.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he went to the Chief
and said, &quot;Oh, Chief, I know where the giants live and I swear to you that
I am going to kill them. It is I alone who can rid you of these pests.&quot;
&quot;You!&quot; said the Chief in great surprise; &quot;little harm the like
of you can do to giants; they will eat you up in one mouthful,&quot; and he
laughed loudly at Rabbit's boldness. And he called to his warriors saying,
&quot;See what a stout fighter we have here! Little Rabbit says he can do what
we have failed to do; he swears that he will kill the giants; he is better
fitted to kill a mouse!&quot; And they all laughed loud haw-haws at Rabbit's
vanity.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Poor Rabbit's pride was
deeply hurt by the Chief's scorn and the warriors' cruel laughter, but it all
made him more determined than ever to slay the thieving giants. So he went to
an old woman who lived near-by and said, &quot;Give me an old faded dress and a
ragged old shawl and your coloured spectacles and a hat with a feather in
it.&quot; The old woman wondered what tricks he was up to now, but she gave him
what he asked for. He put on the tattered old dress and the battered old hat
with a red feather sticking from the top, and he wrapped the old shawl about
his face, and he wore the woman's coloured spectacles and he carried a crooked
stick. And dressed in this fashion he set out towards evening for the giants'
home. When he reached the mouth of the cave, he stood still and waited, leaning
on his crooked stick, for night was coming on and he knew that the giants would
soon be going out on their plundering rounds.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a time when it was
quite dark except for the moonlight, the giant's old witch wife came out of the
cave. When she saw Rabbit in the dim light she said gruffly, &quot;Who are you,
standing there in the shadows?&quot; &quot;Oh, my dear niece,&quot; said
Rabbit, &quot;I have found you at last. I am your poor old aunt. I thought I
had lost my way. I have come to see you from your home in the far country. It
was a long journey and my poor old legs and back are stiff and sore, and I am
very hungry and tired;&quot; and he moved slowly towards the woman, hobbling
along with his crooked stick. The giant woman was deceived, and she threw her
arms around Rabbit and kissed him, and she did not feel his whiskers or his
split lip because of the old shawl that was wrapped around his face. &quot;I
have a pain in my jaw from sleeping out of doors,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;and
I must keep my face wrapped up.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Come in and rest,
and you will soon feel better,&quot; said the giant woman.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You will have to
lead me in,&quot; said Rabbit, not wishing to take off the shawl, &quot;for my
eyesight is very bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So she led Rabbit into
the warm cave, which was so dark that they could scarcely see each other, and
she called her husband and said, &quot;Here is my dear old aunt who has come
all the way from the far country beyond the prairies.&quot; And the giant,
believing Rabbit to be his wife's kindred, for he could not see him very
clearly, treated him very kindly. And they showed him the bed where he was to
sleep.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The woman then gave
Rabbit a large piece of dried meat to eat. But Rabbit said, &quot;I cannot eat
it, for I am old and I have lost all my teeth. Give me an axe to cut it up
small.&quot; So the woman brought him a sharp axe and he chopped the meat into
small pieces and ate it all up. And he said, &quot;I will keep the axe by me,
for I shall need it at all my meals,&quot; and he placed it beside his bed. The
giant said, &quot;We are going away to see some friends, but we shall be back
before midnight.&quot; But before they went away Rabbit said to the woman,
&quot;I hope your husband sleeps soundly; I have a bad cough and I sometimes
moan because of the pain in my face and head and I do not wish to disturb
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And the old giant woman
answered, &quot;He slumbers too well. When we sleep we both snore loudly, and
when you hear us snoring you may cough as much as you please, for then you will
know that we are sound asleep.&quot; Then the man and his witch wife went away.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the giants came
home, Rabbit pretended to be fast asleep. They brought back with them much food
which they hid in a secret place at the side of the cave. Rabbit watched them
through the holes in the old shawl around his head. Soon they went to bed,
drowsy after their fat meal. When Rabbit heard them snoring loudly like a great
waterfall, &quot;chr-r-r, chr-r-r,&quot; he arose very quietly and crept softly
to their bedside. With two blows of his axe he killed the giant and his wife,
one after the other. Then he ran away as fast as he could, carrying with him
his old dress and hat and shawl, for he thought he might need them again.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the morning he went
to the Chief's house and told the Chief what he had done. The Chief laughed
scornfully and he would not believe it until Rabbit brought him to the cave and
showed him the slain giants cold and stiff in their bed. The Chief's men then
took back to the village the great store of food the giants had hidden in the
secret place. But the Chief and his warriors, although they were glad to be rid
of the thieves, were angry at heart because Rabbit whom they had laughed at had
done what they had failed to do, for they were very jealous of Rabbit's power.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day soon afterwards
the Chief called all the birds and the animals to a council, and he said,
&quot;Now that the giants who robbed us of our food are dead and gone, and that
we shall never again want for nourishment in my country, I am going to let each
animal and bird choose the kind of food he would most like to live on if he
could get it. And they shall never want for that kind of food if it can be
provided.&quot; And he called on each to make the choice. And the birds said
&quot;Grain and seeds and worms,&quot; and the Squirrel said &quot;Nuts,&quot;
and the Fox said &quot;Chickens,&quot; and the cat said &quot;Milk,&quot; and
the dog said &quot;Meat and bones,&quot; and the weasel said &quot;Eggs,&quot;
and the wolf said &quot;Lambs,&quot; and the bear said &quot;Fish from the
frozen sea,&quot; and so on until each animal was called upon and declared his
liking. And the Chief said, &quot;It shall be as you have chosen.&quot; But the
Chief had purposely neglected to summon poor Rabbit to the council, and Rabbit
was absent on a long journey. When he came home, he was very angry when he heard
what had happened, for only the left-over in the world's food remained for him
to choose. So he went to the Chief and said in great wrath, &quot;This is a
fine return for ridding your land of giants. But that is a way you have; you
always reward good deeds with evil.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Chief was very angry
because of Rabbit's insolence, and he said, &quot;You are telling lies
again.&quot; But Rabbit called as witnesses to the truth of what he said Sheep
and Goat and Duck who chanced to be passing by and who stood listening to the quarrel.
And old Sheep said, &quot;Rabbit has spoken truly. When I was young I gave the
Chief much wool to make clothes for his back and he used me well. But now that
I am old he is going to kill me and eat me up. That is my reward.&quot; And old
Goat said, &quot;Rabbit has spoken wisely and justly. I served the Chief well
in my time and gave him milk, but now that I am old and have no more milk he is
fattening me and getting me ready for slaughter. That is my reward.&quot; And
old Duck said, &quot;That is a true saying of Rabbit. Once upon a time I gave
the Chief many eggs and young ducklings, but now that I have stopped laying he
is soon going to roast me in a pot. That is my reward.&quot; The Chief could
make no answer to these charges, for he knew them to be true, and he offered to
do what was in his power for Rabbit. But Rabbit refused to make choice of food,
for he said the best was already gone. He sulked for many months and lived
alone by his own efforts as best he could.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last he decided to
take vengeance on the Chief. And he hit, as was his custom, on a crafty trick.
The Chief had an old Bear which he prized very highly, for the Bear did for him
many wondrous tricks and brought laughter to him and his warriors when he
danced at their feasts. In those olden times Bear had a long bushy tail of
which he was very proud. One day as Rabbit sat on the ice fishing—for it was
now winter—Bear came along. There was to be a feast that night and he was going
to dance for the Chief, and he was in very good spirits. &quot;Where did you
get all the fine fish?&quot; he asked, for he was a great fish eater. &quot;I
caught them through the hole in the ice,&quot; said Rabbit. &quot;It is very
easy. Just drop your tail down through the hole and it will soon be covered
with fine big fish.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Bear did as he was told,
and he sat on the ice for a long time waiting for his prey. He sat so long that
the hole froze up, for it was very cold, and in it was frozen poor Bear's long
bushy tail. &quot;Now,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;jump quick, for many fish are
hanging to you.&quot; Bear jumped with all his might, but his tail was held
fast in the ice and it broke off close to the root. Rabbit laughed in great
glee and ran away. And poor Bear howled with pain and shame. He could not dance
at the feast because his stub of a tail was sore, and the Chief and the warriors
were very angry at Rabbit because he had harmed their dancing pet. And since
that time Bear has had a short stubby tail which to this day he tries to wag
feebly.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rabbit then hid for some
days far from the Chief and his warriors. Then he decided to try another trick.
The Chief's wood-cutter was old Beaver, who lived in a little house of reeds on
the bank of a stream. He was very busy now cutting down trees for the Chief,
for it was near to spring-time and the people were in need of logs for building
roads over the rivers. One day Rabbit went to Beaver and said, &quot;The Chief
sent me to you to bring you to a great tree he wishes you to cut down at
once.&quot; So Beaver went along with him. But when Beaver was busy at his task
cutting down the tree, Rabbit hit him a savage blow on the head with a big
stick hoping to kill him and thus again to anger the Chief. Poor Beaver fell to
the ground and Rabbit ran away. But Beaver was only stunned. He got up after a
time and went home muttering to himself and rubbing his sore head. Soon Rabbit
came back to the tree and found Beaver gone. He knew that his blow had failed.
Then he put on again his tattered old dress and his ragged shawl and his
coloured spectacles and the hat with the red feather sticking to the top, and
he went to Beaver's house by the stream, hobbling along with a stick. &quot;The
Chief sent me to you to bring you to a great tree he wishes you to cut down at
once,&quot; he called. And Beaver said, &quot;I have already tried to cut a
great tree for him to-day and I should have finished it had I not been beaten
with a stick until I was stunned by the blow.&quot; &quot;Who struck you?&quot;
asked Rabbit, laughing to himself. &quot;Rabbit struck me,&quot; answered
Beaver. &quot;He is a great brigand and a liar and a thief,&quot; said Rabbit.
&quot;He is all that,&quot; said Beaver, rubbing the lump on his head. So
Beaver went along with Rabbit. And Rabbit asked as they went along, &quot;How
is it that you are alive after that cruel blow?&quot; And Beaver said,
&quot;Rabbit hit me on the head. If he had hit me on the back of my neck he would
have killed me, for there I keep the secret of my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Beaver was busy
again at his task cutting down the tree, Rabbit hit him a powerful blow on the
back of the neck and poor Beaver fell down dead. Then he cut off his tail that
was made like a file, and went away happy, for he knew that the Chief would be
very angry when he found what had happened to his wood-cutter.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Chief learned
that Beaver had been killed, his wrath knew no bounds, for he could ill afford
at this time to lose his best wood-chopper. He blamed Rabbit for the deed, but
he could not be sure that his suspicions were well-founded. Rabbit kept out of
the Chief's sight for some weeks. But one day in early summer he was very
hungry. He saw all the other animals filling their bellies with their favourite
food, and he decided to forget his sulks and to ask the Chief for help. So he
went to the Chief and said haughtily, &quot;I want you to give me food for my
own special use as you have done with the other animals. You must do it at once
or I will do you much harm.&quot; Then the Chief remembered what Rabbit had
done to his dancing Bear, and he thought of the death of Beaver, for which he
blamed Rabbit without proof, and he grew red with anger. He seized Rabbit by
the heels and said, &quot;Henceforth the dogs will always chase you, and you
will never have peace when they are near. And you will live for the most part
on whatever food I throw you into now.&quot; Then he whirled Rabbit around his
head by the heels, and he threw him from him with great force, hoping to drop
him in a great black swamp near-by. Poor Rabbit went flying through the air for
a great distance, farther than the Chief had hoped, and he dropped with a thud
into a field of clover on the edge of which cabbages and lettuce were growing. And
since that time the dogs have always chased Rabbit and he has lived for the
most part on cabbages and lettuce and clover which he steals on moonlight
nights from farmers' fields.</span></p>

Three Tests</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Somewhere near the sea
in olden times a boy was living with his father and mother. He had no brothers
or sisters. His father was a great hunter and the boy inherited something of
his power, for he was always very successful in the killing of game. And his
mother said, &quot;Some day he will be a great man, for before his birth a
vision came to me in the night and told me that my son would win wide fame. And
fairy gifts were laid by the fairies in his cradle.&quot; And his father,
listening to her boasting, said, &quot;Time will tell; time will tell; but if
he is to be a great man it is his own deeds and not your boasting that must
prove it.&quot; As the boy grew up he became strangely beautiful and he had
great strength. And his father said, &quot;It is time he set out to seek his
fortune. I was in the forest doing for myself when I was no older than
he.&quot; And his mother said, &quot;Wait a little and be not so impatient. He
is yet young and there is yet much time.&quot; So the boy remained at home a
while longer.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it happened that far
away in a distant village there lived a young girl of very great beauty and
grace. Her father had been a great Chief, but he was now dead. Her mother too
was dead, and she was all alone in the world. But her parents had left her vast
lands and a great store of goods and many servants, and because of her
treasures and her great beauty she had many suitors. But she was not easily
pleased by men and on all who came to seek her hand she imposed severe feats of
skill to test their sincerity and their worth. She was carefully guarded by an
old woman and many servants who kept troublesome and meddlesome people away.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon the fame of the
girl's wealth and beauty spread through all the land. It reached the sea coast
village where the young man dwelt. His father thought to himself, &quot;Here is
a good chance for my son to prove his worth.&quot; So he called his boy to him
and said, &quot;It is time you were setting out to seek your fortune in the
world and to find a wife, for your spring-time is passing and your summer of
life will soon be here, and before you know it your autumn will be upon you and
your winter will be near. There is no time to lose. Seek out the beautiful girl
of the rich treasures in the distant inland village and try to win her as your
wife.&quot; And his mother gave him the fairy gifts which had been laid in his
cradle at his birth, and he said good-bye to his parents and set out on his
long journey. He had no misgivings, for he was very vain of his beauty and he
was sure, too, of his strength.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he travelled inland
he came one day upon a man clad in scarlet sitting on the side of a rocky hill
tying stones to his feet. &quot;Hello,&quot; he said to the man, &quot;why are
you tying these heavy rocks to your ankles?&quot; &quot;I am a hunter,&quot;
replied the man, &quot;but when I follow the deer I run so fast that I am soon
far in front of them instead of behind them, and I am putting heavy weights on
my feet so that I will not run so rapidly.&quot; &quot;You are indeed a
wonderful man,&quot; said the boy; &quot;but I am alone and I need a companion.
Let us go along together.&quot; &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the man. &quot;I
am Lad of the Great Heart,&quot; said the boy, &quot;and I can do great deeds
and I can win for you great treasure.&quot; So the Scarlet Runner went along
with him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Towards evening when
they were now far inland, they came to a large lake. Among the trees on the
fringe of the lake a large fat man was lying flat on his stomach with his mouth
in the water drinking as hard as he could. For some time they watched him, but
still he drank and the lake grew smaller and smaller and still his thirst was
not quenched. They laughed at such a strange sight, and as they approached him
the boy said, &quot;Hello! Why do you lie there drinking so much water?&quot;
&quot;Oh,&quot; answered the fat man, &quot;there are times when I cannot get
enough water to drink. When I have drunk this lake dry I shall still be
thirsty.&quot; &quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the boy. &quot;I am Man of the
Great Thirst,&quot; said the fat man. &quot;That is well,&quot; said Great
Heart, &quot;we two need a third companion. We can do great deeds and we can
win for you great treasure.&quot; So the three went along together.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They had not gone far
when they came to a wide open plain where they saw a man walking along with his
face raised upwards, peering at the sky. He moved along rapidly and seemed to
find his way without his eyes, for he gazed steadily at the heavens.
&quot;Hello,&quot; said Great Heart as the sky-gazer rushed past him and almost
knocked him over, &quot;what are you looking at so intently?&quot;
&quot;Oh,&quot; said the man, &quot;I have shot an arrow into the sky and I am
waiting for it to fall. It has gone so far that it will be some time before it
drops.&quot; &quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the boy. &quot;I am the
Far-Darter,&quot; said the sky-gazer. &quot;We three need a fourth
companion,&quot; said the boy. &quot;We can do great deeds and win for you much
treasure. Come along with us.&quot; So the four went along together.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They had gone but a short
distance across the plain to the edge of a forest when they came upon a man
lying down at full length with his head upon his hand. The edge of his hand was
on the ground and it was half closed around his ear, which rested upon it. As
he saw the four men approaching him he placed a finger of his other hand upon
his lips and signalled to them to keep quiet. &quot;Hello,&quot; said Great
Heart in a whisper, &quot;what are you doing there with your ear to the
ground?&quot; &quot;I am listening to the plants growing far away in the forest,&quot;
he answered. &quot;There is a beautiful flower I wish to find, and I am trying
to hear it breathing so that I may go and get it. Aha! I hear it now.&quot; So
saying he rose from the ground. The boy said, &quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;I
am Keen Ears,&quot; said the listener. &quot;We four need another
companion,&quot; said Great Heart. &quot;We can do great deeds and win for you
much treasure. Come along with us.&quot; So the four men and the boy went along
together, Keen Ears, and Scarlet Runner, and Far Darter, and Man of the Great
Thirst, and Lad of the Great Heart. Then Great Heart unfolded to the others his
plan to win the beautiful girl who lived with her treasures in the distant
village. And they gladly agreed to help him in his dangerous undertaking.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they reached the
village, the people were all very curious when they saw the five strangers.
They marvelled at Great Heart's beauty. But when they heard that he wished to
marry the daughter of the former Chief they shook their heads gravely and said,
&quot;It will never be. She places hard conditions on all who seek her hand. He
who fails in the tests is doomed to death. Many suitors have tried and failed
and died.&quot; But Great Heart was not alarmed, and with his four companions
he went to the girl's home. The old woman who guarded her met him at the door
and he made known his wishes. She laughed scornfully when she saw his great
beauty, and she said, &quot;You look more like a girl than like a warrior. You
cannot endure the tests.&quot; But the young man insisted on making the trials.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old woman said,
&quot;If you fail in the tests you will die,&quot; and Great Heart said,
&quot;It is so agreed.&quot; Then the woman said, &quot;If you wish to win the
maiden you must first push away this great rock from before her window. It
keeps the sunlight from her in the mornings.&quot; Then Great Heart, calling to
his aid the fairy gifts of his cradle, placed his shoulder against the huge
stone which rose higher than the house, and he pushed with all his strength.
With a mighty crash it rolled down the hill and broke into millions of pieces.
The bits of rock flew all over the earth so great was the fall, and the little
pebbles and stones that came from it are seen throughout the world to this day.
The sunlight streamed in at the window, and the maiden knew that the first test
had been successfully passed by a suitor.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then came the second
test. The old woman and her servants brought great quantities of food and drink
and bade the strangers consume it all at one meal. They were very hungry, for
they had eaten nothing all day and they easily ate up the food. But when Great
Heart saw the great barrels of water, his spirits sank, and he said, &quot;I
fear I am beaten.&quot; But Man of the Great Thirst said, &quot;Not so fast, my
friend. The spell of great stomach-burning is again upon me. I am very dry as
if there was a fire in my belly. Give me a chance to drink.&quot; He went from
barrel to barrel and in a twinkling he had drained them all of every drop. And
the people wondered greatly.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But there was still
another test. &quot;You must have one of your party run a race,&quot; said the old
woman to Great Heart. And she brought out a man who had never been beaten in
running. &quot;Who is your choice of runners?&quot; she asked; &quot;he must
race with this man, and if he wins you may have the maiden for your wife and
all the treasure with her, for this is the final test. But if he loses the race
you shall die.&quot; Great Heart called Scarlet Runner to the mark and told the
old woman that this was the man selected. Then he untied the rocks from the
runner's feet, and when all was ready the race began. The course lay far across
the plains for many miles until the runners should pass from sight, and back
again to the starting point. The two runners kept together for some distance,
talking together in a friendly way as they ran. When they had passed from sight
of the village the maiden's runner said, &quot;Now we are out of sight of the
village. Let us rest here a while on this grassy bank, for the day is
hot.&quot; The Scarlet Runner agreed to this and they both stretched out on the
grass. Now this was an old trick of the maiden's runner, who always won by
craft rather than by speed. They had not lain down long on the grass when
Scarlet Runner fell asleep under the hot sun, just as his rival had hoped. When
the latter was sure that his rival was sound asleep, he set out for the
village, running as fast as he could. The people soon saw their runner
approaching far off on the plains, but there was no sign of the stranger, and
they thought that the new suitor for the girl's hand had at last failed like
all the others before him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Great Heart was much
puzzled when Scarlet Runner did not appear, and as he saw the maiden's runner
coming nearer, he said, &quot;What can have happened? I fear I am beaten.&quot;
But Keen Ears threw himself flat on the ground and listened. &quot;Scarlet Runner
is asleep,&quot; he called; &quot;I hear him snoring on the plains far
away.&quot; And with his keen sense of sound he located the exact spot where
the runner was lying. &quot;I will soon wake him,&quot; said Far-Darter, as he
fitted an arrow to his bow-string. The people all thought him mad, for they had
never seen an arrow shot so great a distance beyond their sight. But Far-Darter
was not dismayed. He quickly shot an arrow from his bow to the spot which Keen
Ears had indicated. His aim was so true that the arrow hit Scarlet Runner on the
nose and aroused him from his sleep. But when he rose to his feet he found that
his rival was gone and he knew that he had been deceived. So in a great rage
because of the trick and the pain in his nose, he set out for the village
running like the wind. His rival had almost reached the end of the race, but by
putting all his strength into his effort, Scarlet Runner quickly over-took him
and passed him near the winning-post and won the race. And the people wondered
greatly at these great deeds of the strangers.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the old woman said
to Great Heart, &quot;You have won the maiden as your wife, for you alone have
succeeded in these tests.&quot; So the two were married with great ceremony.
Great Heart gave much treasure to his companions, and they promised to help him
always in his need. Then with his wife and her servants and her great store of
goods he went back to his native village by the sea. His father and mother were
glad to see him again and to hear of his success, and his mother said, &quot;I
told you he would win great fame because of the fairy gifts that were laid in
his cradle at his birth.&quot; And they all lived together and were henceforth
very happy.</span></p>

Twilight Sky</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Long ago there dwelt on
the shores of the Great Water in the west a young man and his younger wife.
They had no children and they lived all by themselves far from other people on
an island not far from the coast. The man spent his time in catching the
deep-sea fish far out on the ocean, or in spearing salmon in the distant
rivers. Often he was gone for many days and his wife was very lonely in his
absence. She was not afraid, for she had a stout spirit, but it was very dismal
in the evenings to look only at the grey leaden sky and to hear only the sound
of the surf as it beat upon the beach. So day after day she said to herself,
&quot;I wish we had children. They would be good company for me when I am alone
and my husband is far away.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One evening at twilight
when she was solitary because of her husband's absence on the ocean catching
the deep-sea fish, she sat on the sand beach looking out across the water. The
sky in the west was pale grey; it was always dull and grey in that country, and
when the sun had gone down there was no soft light. In her loneliness the woman
said to herself, &quot;I wish we had children to keep me company.&quot; A
Kingfisher, with his children, was diving for minnows not far away. And the
woman said, &quot;Oh, sea bird with the white collar, I wish we had children
like you.&quot; And the Kingfisher said, &quot;Look in the sea-shells; look in
the sea-shells,&quot; and flew away. The next evening the woman sat again upon
the beach looking westward at the dull grey sky. Not far away a white Sea-gull
was riding on the waves in the midst of her brood of little ones. And the woman
said, &quot;Oh, white sea bird, I wish we had children like you to keep us
company.&quot; And the Sea-gull said, &quot;Look in the sea-shells; look in the
sea-shells,&quot; and flew away.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The woman wondered
greatly at the words of the Kingfisher and the Sea-Gull. As she sat there in
thought she heard a strange cry coming from the sand dunes behind her. She went
closer to the sound and found that the cry came from a large sea-shell lying on
the sand. She picked up the shell, and inside of it was a tiny boy, crying as
hard as he could. She was well pleased with her discovery, and she carried the
baby to her home and cared for him. When her husband came home from the sea,
he, too, was very happy to find the baby there, for he knew that they would be
lonely no more.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The baby grew very
rapidly, and soon he was able to walk and move about where he pleased. One day
the woman was wearing a copper bracelet on her arm and the child said to her,
&quot;I must have a bow made from the copper on your arm.&quot; So to please
him she made him a tiny bow from the bracelet, and two tiny arrows. At once he
set out to hunt game, and day after day he came home bearing the products of
his chase. He brought home geese and ducks and brant and small sea birds, and
gave them to his mother for food. As he grew older the man and his wife noticed
that his face took on a golden hue brighter than the colour of his copper bow.
Wherever he went there was a strange light. When he sat on the beach looking to
the west the weather was always calm and there were strange bright gleams upon
the water. And his foster-parents wondered greatly at this unusual power. But
the boy would not talk about it; when they spoke of it he was always silent.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened once that
the winds blew hard over the Great Water and the man could not go out to catch
fish because of the turbulent sea. For many days he stayed on shore, for the
ocean, which was usually at peace, was lashed into a great fury and the waves
were dashing high on the beach. Soon the people were in need of fish for food.
And the boy said, &quot;I will go out with you, for I can overcome the Storm
Spirit.&quot; The man did not want to go, but at last he listened to the boy's
entreaties and together they set out for the fishing grounds far across the
tossing sea. They had not gone far when they met the Spirit of the Storm coming
madly from the south-west where the great winds dwelt. He tried hard to upset
their boat, but over them he had no power, for the boy guided the frail craft
across the water and all around them the sea was calm and still. Then the Storm
Spirit called his nephew Black Cloud to help him, and away in the south-east
they saw him hurrying to his uncle's aid. But the boy said to the man, &quot;Be
not afraid, for I am more than a match for him.&quot; So the two met, but when
Black Cloud saw the boy he quickly disappeared. Then the Spirit of the Storm
called Mist of the Sea to come and cover the water, for he thought the boat
would be lost if he hid the land from the man and the boy. When the man saw
Mist of the Sea coming like a grey vapour across the water he was very
frightened, for of all his enemies on the ocean he feared this one most. But
the boy said, &quot;He cannot harm you when I am with you.&quot; And sure
enough, when Mist of the Sea saw the boy sitting smiling in the boat he
disappeared as quickly as he had come. And the Storm Spirit in great anger
hurried away to other parts, and that day there was no more danger on the sea
near the fishing grounds.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy and the man soon
reached the fishing grounds in safety. And the boy taught his foster-father a
magic song with which he was able to lure fish to his nets. Before evening came
the boat was filled with good fat fish and they set out for their home. The man
said, &quot;Tell me the secret of your power.&quot; But the boy said, &quot;It
is not yet time.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day the boy killed
many birds. He skinned them all and dried their skins. Then he dressed himself
in the skin of a plover and rose into the air and flew above the sea. And the
sea under him was grey like his wings. Then he came down and dressed himself in
the skin of a blue-jay and soared away again. And the sea over which he was
flying was at once changed to blue like the blue of his wings. When he came
back to the beach, he put on the skin of a robin with the breast of a golden
hue like his face. Then he flew high and at once the waves under him reflected
a colour as of fire and bright gleams of light appeared upon the ocean, and the
sky in the west was golden red. The boy flew back to the beach and he said to
his foster-parents, &quot;Now it is time for me to leave you. I am the
offspring of the sun. Yesterday my power was tested and it was not found
wanting, so now I must go away and I shall see you no more. But at evening I
shall appear to you often in the twilight sky in the west. And when the sky and
the sea look at evening like the colour of my face, you will know that there
will be no wind nor storm and that on the morrow the weather will be fair. But
although I go away, I shall leave you a strange power. And always when you need
me, let me know your desires by making white offerings to me, so that I may see
them from my home far in the west.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he gave to his
foster-mother a wonderful robe. He bade his parents good-bye, and soared away
to the west, leaving them in sadness. But the woman still keeps a part of the
power he gave her, and when she sits on the island in a crevice in the dunes
and loosens her wonderful robe, the wind hurries down from the land, and the
sea is ruffled with storm; and the more she loosens the garment the greater is
the tempest. But in the late autumn when the cold mists come in from the sea,
and the evenings are chill, and the sky is dull and grey, she remembers the
promise of the boy. And she makes to him an offering of tiny white feathers
plucked from the breasts of birds. She throws them into the air, and they
appear as flakes of snow and rise thickly into the winds. And they hurry
westward to tell the boy that the world is grey and dreary as it yearns for the
sight of his golden face. Then he appears to the people of earth. He comes at
evening and lingers after the sun has gone, until the twilight sky is red, and
the ocean in the west has gleams of golden light. And the people then know that
there will be no wind and that on the morrow the weather will be fair, as he
promised them long ago.</span></p>

world was still young, Raven and White Sea-gull lived near together in Canada,
far in the north country on the shores of the Great Water in the west. They
were very good friends and they always worked in harmony and they had much food
and many servants in common. White Sea-gull knew no guile; he was always very
open and frank and honest in his dealings with others. But Raven was a sly
fellow, and at times he was not lacking in treachery and deceit. But Sea-gull
did not suspect him, and the two lived always on very friendly terms. In these
far-back times in the north country all the world was dark and there was no
light but that of the stars. Sea-gull owned all the daylight, but he was very
stingy and he kept it always locked up in a box. He would give none of it to
anyone else, and he never let it out of the box except when he needed a little
of it to help himself when he went far away on his journeys.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a time Raven grew
envious of Sea-gull's possession. And he said, &quot;It is not fair that
Sea-gull should keep the daylight all to himself locked up in a box. It was
meant for all the world and not for him alone, and it would be of great value
to all of us if he would sometimes let a little of it out.&quot; So he went to
Sea-gull and said, &quot;Give me some of your daylight. You do not need it all
and I can use some of it with advantage.&quot; But Sea-gull said, &quot;No. I
want it all for myself. What could you do with daylight, you with your coat as
black as night?&quot; and he would not give him any of it. So Raven made up his
mind that he would have to get some daylight from Sea-gull by stealth.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon afterwards Raven
gathered some prickly thorns and burdocks and scattered them on the ground
between Sea-gull's house and the beach where the canoes were lying. Then he
went to Sea-gull's window and cried loudly, &quot;Our canoes are going adrift
in the surf. Come quickly and help me to save them.&quot; Sea-gull sprang out
of bed and ran half-asleep on his bare feet. But as he ran to the beach the
thorns stuck in his bare flesh, and he howled with pain. He crawled back to his
house, saying, &quot;My canoe may go adrift if it pleases; I cannot walk
because of the splinters in my feet.&quot; Raven chuckled to himself, and he
moved away, pretending to go to the beach to draw up the canoes. Then he went
into Sea-gull's house. Sea-gull was still howling with pain; he was sitting
crying on the side of his bed and he was trying to pull the thorns from his
feet as best he could. &quot;I will help you,&quot; said Raven, &quot;for I
have often done this before. I am a very good doctor.&quot; So he took an awl
made from whale-bone and he caught hold of Sea-gull's foot, with the pretence
of removing the thorns. But instead of taking them out he only pushed them in
farther until poor Sea-gull howled louder than ever. And Raven said, &quot;It
is so dark I cannot see to pull these thorns from your feet. Give me some
daylight and I will soon cure you. A doctor must always have a little
light.&quot; So Sea-gull unlocked the box and lifted the cover just a little
bit so that a faint gleam of light came out. &quot;That is better,&quot; said
Raven. But instead of picking out the thorns he pushed them in as he had done
before, until Sea-gull howled and kicked in pain. &quot;Why are you so stingy
with your light?&quot; snapped Raven. &quot;Do you think I am an owl and that I
can see well enough in the darkness to heal your feet? Open the box wide and I
will soon make you well.&quot; So saying he purposely fell heavily against
Sea-gull and knocked the box on the floor. The cover flew open and daylight
escaped and spread quickly over all the world. Poor Sea-gull tried his best to
lure it back again into the box, but his efforts proved fruitless, for it had
gone for ever. Raven said he was very sorry for the accident, but after he had
taken all the thorns from Sea-gull's feet he went home laughing to himself and
well pleased because of the success of his trick.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon there was light in
all the world. But Raven could not see very well, for the light was too bright
and his eyes were not accustomed to it. He sat for a time looking towards the
east, but he saw there nothing of interest. The next day he saw a bit farther,
for he was now getting used to the new conditions. The third day he could see
distinctly a line of hills far in the east, rising against the sky, and covered
with a blue mist. He looked long at the strange sight. Then he saw far away
towards the hill a thin column of smoke lifting heavenwards. He had never seen
smoke before, but he had often heard of it from travellers in strange places.
&quot;That must be the country of which I have been told,&quot; he said.
&quot;In that land dwell the people who alone possess Fire. We have searched
for it for many ages and now I think we have found it.&quot; Then he thought,
&quot;We now have the daylight, and what a fine thing it would be if we could
also have Fire,&quot; and he determined to set out to find it.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the following day he
called his servants together and told them of his plans. He said, &quot;We
shall set out at once, for the distance is far.&quot; And he asked three of his
best servants, Robin, Mole and Flea, to go with him. Flea brought out his
little wagon and they all tried to get into it, but it was much too small to
hold them. Then they tried Mole's carriage, but it was much too frail, and it
had scarcely started to move when it broke down and they all fell out in a
heap. Then they tried Robin's carriage, but it was much too high and it toppled
over under its heavy load and threw them all to the ground. Then Raven stole
Sea-gull's large strong carriage, for Sea-gull was asleep, and it did very
well, and they started on their journey, taking turns pushing the carriage
along with a pole over the flat plain.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a strange journey
in queer places they reached the land of the people who owned Fire, guided
along by the thin column of smoke. The people were not people of earth. Some
say they were the Fish people, but that, no man knows. They sat around in a
large circle with Fire in their midst, for it was autumn and the days and
nights were chill. And Fire was in many places. Raven looked on for a while
from afar thinking of the best plan to obtain Fire. Then he said to Robin,
&quot;You can move faster than any of us. You must steal Fire. You can fly in
quickly, pick it up in your bill and take it back to us and the people will not
see nor hear you.&quot; So Robin picked out a spot where there were few people,
and he darted in quickly and picked up fire in a twinkling and flew back
unharmed towards his companions. But he had only taken a very little bit of it.
When he got half-way back to his friends, Fire was so hot in his bill that it
gave him a strange pain and he had to drop it on the ground. It fell to the
earth with a crash and it was so small that it flickered faintly. Robin called
to his companions to bring the carriage. Then he stood over Fire and fanned it
with his wings to keep it alive. It was very hot, but he stood bravely to his
task until his breast was badly scorched and he had to move away. His efforts
to save Fire were of no avail, and before his companions reached him Fire had
died, and only a black coal remained. And poor Robin's breast was singed, and
to this day the breasts of his descendants are a reddish-brown colour because
he was scorched while trying to steal Fire ages ago.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Raven asked Flea to
make the attempt to steal Fire. But Flea said, &quot;I am too little. The heat
would roast me to death; and, further, I might miscalculate the distance and
hop into the flame.&quot; Then Raven asked Mole to try, but Mole said, &quot;Oh
no, I am better fitted for other work. My fur would all be singed like Robin's
breast.&quot; Raven took good care that he would not go himself, for he was a
great coward. So he said, &quot;There is a better and easier way. We will steal
the baby of the Chief and hold him for ransom. Perhaps they will give us Fire
in exchange for him,&quot; and they all thought this was a very good idea.
Raven asked, &quot;Who will volunteer to steal the baby?&quot; for he always
made the others do all the work. Flea said, &quot;I will go. In one jump I will
be into the house, and in another jump I will be out again, for I can hop a
great distance.&quot; But the others laughed and said, &quot;You could not
carry the baby; you are too small.&quot; The Mole said, &quot;I will go. I can
tunnel a passage very quietly under the house and right up to the baby's
cradle. I can then steal the baby and no one will hear me or see me.&quot; So
it was agreed that Mole should go. In a few minutes Mole made his tunnel, and
he was soon back with the baby. Then they got into their carriage and hurried
home with their prize.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Chief of the
Fire people discovered the loss of his child he was very angry. And in all the
land there was great sorrow because the Chief's heir, the hope of the tribe,
had gone. And the child's mother and her women wept so bitterly that their
tears fell like rain on all the land. The Chief said he would give anything he
possessed to find his child. But although his people searched far and near,
they could not find the baby. After many days a wayfarer who had come far from
the Great Water in the west brought them news that a strange child was living
far to the westward in the village by the sea. He said, &quot;He is not of
their tribe. He looks like the children of your village,&quot; and he advised
them to go to see him for themselves. So the Chief sent his men to search for
them guided by the wayfarer. When they reached Raven's village they were told
that a strange baby was indeed there; the child was described to them, but he
was kept out of sight, and Raven would not tell how he had happened to come
there. And Raven said, &quot;How do I know he is your Chief's child? People
tell strange lies these days. If you want him you can pay for him, for he has
caused us much trouble and expense.&quot; So the messengers went back and reported
to the Chief what they had heard. From the description, the Chief knew that the
child was his, so he gave the messengers very valuable presents of pearls and
rich robes and sent them back again to ransom his boy. But Raven, when he saw
the presents, said, &quot;No, I do not want these gifts; they do not pay me for
my trouble,&quot; and he would not part with the baby. The messengers again
reported to the Chief what had happened. Then the Chief gave them still richer
gifts, the best he had in all his land, and sent them back. But again Raven
said, &quot;No, your gifts are valueless, compared with my trouble and expense.
Say this to your Chief.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Chief heard
this from his messengers he was sore perplexed, for he had offered the best he
had, and he thought that he had reached the end of his resources. So he said,
&quot;Go back and ask the people to demand what they wish in exchange for my
boy and they will receive it if it can be provided.&quot; So the messengers
went back to Raven and spoke as they had been commanded. And Raven said,
&quot;Only one thing can pay for the child, and that is Fire. Give me Fire and
you can take the baby.&quot; The messenger laughed and said, &quot;Why did you
not say so at first and save us all this trouble and anxiety? Fire is the most
plentiful thing in our kingdom, and we hold it in no value.&quot; So they
returned happy to the Chief. And he sent back much Fire and received his child
unharmed from Raven in exchange. And he sent Raven two small stones which the
messengers taught Raven how to use. And they said, &quot;If you ever lose Fire
or if it dies for lack of food you can always call it back to life with these
two little stones.&quot; Then they showed him how to make Fire with the two
little stones and withered grass, and birch-bark and dry pine, and Raven
thought it was very easy. And he felt very proud because he had brought Fire
and Light to the earth. He kept Fire for himself for a long time, and although
the people clamoured loudly for it, he would not give any of it away. Soon,
however, he decided to sell a quantity of it, for he now had the power of
making it. So he said to himself, &quot;This is a good way to get many
wives,&quot; and he announced that he would only sell some of his fire in
return for a wife. And many families bought his fire and in exchange he
received many wives. And to this day he still has many wives and he still moves
about from place to place with a flock of them always around him. But the
Indians when they arrived took Fire away from him. Thus Fire came to the
Indians in the olden days. And when it has died, as it often does, they still
sometimes use Raven's flint stones to bring it back to life.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the bank of a stream
far in the West, Owl-man lived long ago in a little house under the ground. He
had very strange habits. He always kept away from the Great Water and he dwelt
for the most part in the forest. He had very few friends, and he usually went
hunting by himself. He lived on toads and frogs and flies. He would say but
little, and when other people sat around him talking pleasantly, he was always
silent, gazing into space with wide-open eyes, and trying to look wiser than he
really was. Because of this, people thought he was very queer, and strange
stories about him soon spread far and wide. It was said that he was very cruel,
and that he was silent because he was always brooding over his past wickedness
or thinking about some evil deed he was soon going to do. And when children
were troublesome or disobedient, their mothers always frightened them into
goodness by saying, &quot;The Owl-man from the stream will come and take you if
you do not mend your ways.&quot; And although the Owl-man was a solitary fellow
he thus had great influence in all the land.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Not far away lived a man
and a woman who had one adopted daughter. Because she was the only child in the
house she was much petted, and she was never satisfied, and she cried and
fretted all the time, and kept always asking for things she could not get. She
disturbed all the neighbours round about so that they could not sleep because of
her constant wailing and complaining. At last her foster-parents grew tired of
her weeping and they said, &quot;The Owl-man will carry you off if you do not
stop crying.&quot; But still she pouted and fretted. And the old man of the
house said, &quot;I wish the Owl-man would come and take her away.&quot; Now
the old man was a great magician, and as he wished, so it came to pass.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That evening it happened
that the people were gathered at a feast of shell-fish on the beach by the
bright moonlight, as was their weekly custom. But the sorrowful girl would not
go with the others. She stayed at home and sulked. As she sat alone in the
house, old Owl-man came along carrying his basket full of toads and frogs. The
girl was still crying when he came in. &quot;I have come for you,&quot; he
said, &quot;as the old man wished.&quot; And he put her in his basket with the
toads and frogs and carried her off. She yelled and kicked and scratched, but
the lid of the basket was tightly closed and Owl-man laughed to himself and
said, &quot;Now I have a wife at last. I shall be alone no more, and the people
will not now think I am so queer.&quot; So he took her to his underground house
by the stream. That night the people noticed that the girl's cries were no
longer heard and they said, &quot;What can have cured Sour-face; what can have
pleased Cry-Baby into silence?&quot; And the girl's foster-mother wondered
where she had gone. But only the old man knew that it had happened as he had
wished, because of his magic power, and that Owl-man had taken her away.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The girl was not happy
in her new home, for she would not be happy in any place. She still kept up her
caterwauling and there was no peace in the house. Owl-man was a great hunter.
Every day he went out hunting with his big basket on his arm, but he always
locked his wife in the house before he went away. He was always very successful
in the chase, and each night he came back with his basket full of toads and
frogs and field-mice and flies. But his wife would eat none of them and she
threw them in his face when he offered them to her, and said in a bad temper,
&quot;I will not eat your filthy food. It is not fit food for
gentle-folk.&quot; And Owl-man said, &quot;Gentle-folk indeed! You should find
a more suitable name; you are not gentle; you are a wild evil thing, but I am
going to tame you.&quot; And the girl wept again and sulked and stamped her
feet in her temper.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last the girl became
very hungry, for there was little to eat except the food that Owl-man brought
home for himself. He gathered a few berries for her, but even these did not
satisfy her hunger. So she thought out a plan of escape. One day when Owl-man
was away, she took some oil she found in the house and rubbed it all over her
face and hair. When Owl-man came home in the evening, he said, &quot;You are
very pretty to-night. What have you done to make yourself look so sleek and
shiny?&quot; And she answered, &quot;I have put on my face and hair gum which I
picked from the trees last night when I went walking with you.&quot; And he
said, &quot;I should like to put some on too, for perhaps it would make me
beautiful.&quot; The girl told him that if he would go out and gather some gum
she would put it on his face and hair for him. So he went out and gathered a
great store of gum from the trees and brought it back to her. She melted it on
a hot stove until it was balsam again and would pour easily out. Then she said,
&quot;Shut your eyes so that it will not harm your sight, and I will make your
face and hair beautiful and shining like mine.&quot; Owl-man shut his eyes, and
the girl soon covered his face and head with the soft gum. She put it on very
thick, and she said, &quot;Keep your eyes shut until it dries or it may blind
you.&quot; Owl-man did as he was told, but when the gum dried he could not open
his eyes, and while he was trying to rub it off, the girl slipped out the door
and ran back to her parents, far away by the Great Water.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Owl-man scraped the gum
from his face and head as best he could, and when he could open his eyes again
and could see pretty well, he went out into the night in search of his wife.
And as he went along he cried, &quot;Oh, oh, oh, where is my wife? Where is my
girl? I have lost my wife. I have lost my girl. Oh, oh, oh.&quot; And when the
people heard him calling they thought they would play a trick on him. So they
said, &quot;She is here, she is here.&quot; But when he entered their houses,
the woman they showed him was not his wife, and he went away sorrowful. And the
people all laughed at his confusion, and said, &quot;Owl-man is getting queerer
each day. He is far gone in his head.&quot; Owl-man went from house to house,
but he could not find his wife. Then he went to the trees and searched among
the branches. He pulled the trees up by the roots, thinking she might be hiding
underneath. And he looked into the salmon-traps in the rivers, and kicked them
to pieces in his frenzy. But nowhere was his wife to be found.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he went to the
girl's house, where she was hiding, and he yelled, &quot;Oh, oh, oh, give me my
wife. Give me my girl. I know she is here. Oh, oh, oh.&quot; But the girl's
foster-mother would not give her up. Then he began to tear down the house over
their heads, for the old man of the house was away and there was no one else
strong enough to stop Owl-man in his rage. When the woman saw her house in
danger of falling about her ears, she cried, &quot;Stop; your wife is
here.&quot; And she brought forth the girl from her hiding-place. When Owl-man
saw her, his rage left him and he was happy again.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But just then the old
man of magic power came home. He had heard the hub-bub from a distance. When he
came in and saw the great holes in the roof and the side of his house where
Owl-man had torn away the logs, he was very angry and he said to himself,
&quot;I will punish both Owl-man and the girl for this night's work.&quot; And
he hit upon a plan. He said to Owl-man, &quot;We must give you a hot bath to
melt the gum and take it from your hair, for it will do you no good, and it
will take all the hair off your head.&quot; And Owl-man gladly agreed. So they
filled a great bark tub with water and heated it by placing at the bottom of it
many red-hot stones, after the fashion of Indians in those old days. But the
old man put so many hot stones in the water that it was soon almost boiling
with the heat, and when they put Owl-man into the tub he was almost scalded to
death and he yelled loudly in pain. Then the old man said, &quot;Now I will
take vengeance. You will trouble me no more. You have broken my house.
Henceforth you will be not a man but an Owl, and you will dwell alone in the
forest with few friends, and you will live always on frogs and toads and
field-mice, and people will hear you at night crying for your wife all over the
land, but you shall never find her.&quot; Then with his magic power he changed
him to an Owl and sent him on his way.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He said to the girl,
&quot;You have done me much harm too, and you have brought all this trouble
upon me. Henceforth you will be not a girl but a Fish-Hawk, and you will always
cry and fret and scream as you have done before, and you will never be
satisfied.&quot; And with his magic power he changed her into a Fish-Hawk, and
sent her out to the ocean. And there she screams always, and she is a great
glutton, for she can never get enough to eat. And since that time, Owl and
Fish-Hawk have not dwelt together and have not been on friendly terms. They
live far apart, and Owl keeps to the forest and the mountains, while the other
keeps to the sea. Thus was the old man avenged, and thus was the weeping maiden
punished for her tears. And the cries of Owl and Fish-Hawk are still heard in
many places, one calling for his wife, the other screaming unsatisfied for
something she cannot get.</span></p>

man was a great hunter, and in summer he and his wife and children lived on the
fish and game he captured in the winter. In the spring-time he gathered sap
from the maple trees, from which he made maple syrup and maple sugar with which
to sweeten their food. One day in summer he found three small bears eating his
stock of sugar. When he came upon them, his sugar was all gone, and he was very
cross. With a stout club he killed the little bears and skinned them and dried
their meat. But his wife said, &quot;No good can come of it. You should not
have killed the three little bears, for they were too young for
slaughter.&quot;</span></p>

Bear came along, looking for his lost children. When he saw their skins hanging
up to dry he knew that they had been killed by the hunter. He was very sad and
angry, and he called to the hunter, &quot;You have killed my little motherless
cubs, and in return for that wickedness, some night when you are off your guard
I will kill your children, and then I will kill you and your wife, and I will
devour all your food.&quot; The old man shot at him with his arrows, but the
arrows did not harm him, for he was Brown Bear of the Stony Heart, and he could
not be killed by man. For many nights and days the old man tried to trap him,
but he met with no success. And each day he saw his store of food growing
smaller, for Bear of the Stony Heart stole it always in the night. And he
thought, &quot;We shall all surely starve before the winter comes, and game is

River-God, help me to drown Bear when he comes to fish.&quot; The river came
from the Lime Stone country far back among the rocks, and it was flowing
rapidly to the sea. And the River-God said, &quot;My water cannot tarry. There

&quot;Oh, Spirit of the Storm Cloud, stay here with me to-night and help me to
kill Bear of the Stony Heart, for he seeks to destroy my children. You can send
lightning and thunder to strike him dead.&quot; But the Storm Cloud said,
&quot;I cannot loiter on the way. Far from here there are millions of blades of
corn and grass dying from thirst in the summer heat, for I see the heat waves
rising on the earth, and I am hurrying there with rain to save them.&quot; And
like the River-God and the Wind Spirit he hurried along on his business. The
poor old man was in great sorrow, for it seemed that no one would help him to
rid the land of Bear of the Stony Heart.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he sat wondering what
he should do, an old woman came along. She said, &quot;I am very hungry and
tired, for I have come far. Will you give me food and let me rest here a
while?&quot; And he said, &quot;We have very little food, for Bear of the Stony
Heart steals it from us nightly, but you may share with us what little we
have.&quot; So he went away and brought back to her a good fat meal. While she
was eating her dinner he told her of his troubles with Bear, and he said that
no one would help him to get rid of the pest, and that Bear could not be killed
by man. And the old woman said, &quot;There is a little animal who can kill
Bear of the Stony Heart. He alone can save you. You have done well to me. Here
is a wand which I will give you. Go to sleep here, soon, on the bank of the
river. Wave this wand before you sleep and say what I shall teach you, and when
you awake call to you the first animal you see when you open your eyes. He will
be the animal of which I speak, and he will rid you of the Bear.&quot; She
taught him a little rhyme and gave him a wand which she took from the basket on
her arm; then she hobbled away, and the old man knew that she was the weird
woman of the Fairy Blue Mountain, of whom he had often heard. He marvelled
greatly, but he resolved to do as she had told him.</span></p>

gone, the man waved the little wand three times, and cried:</span></p>

pierce in the centre old Bear's Stony Heart!&quot; </span></p>

justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He repeated the rhyme
three times. Then he felt himself getting drowsy and sleep soon came upon him.
He slept but a short time when the heat woke him up, for the hot sun beat down
upon him. He rubbed his eyes and looked about him. Watching him from behind a
tree was a little animal with a shaggy brown coat. The old man thought to
himself, &quot;Surely the weird fairy woman of the Blue Mountain has played a
trick on me. That scraggy little animal with the dirty coat cannot kill the
Bear.&quot; But he resolved to test her word. He repeated his rhyme again, and
the little animal came quickly towards him. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the
man. &quot;I am Ermine,&quot; said the little animal. &quot;Are you the animal
of which the fairy woman of the Blue Hills has told me?&quot; asked the man.
&quot;I am indeed the same,&quot; said Ermine. &quot;I have been sent to you to
kill the Bear, and here I have the little darts made powerful because of your
magic wand.&quot; He pointed to his mouth and showed the old man his sharp
white teeth. &quot;So now to your task,&quot; said the old man in high spirits.
&quot;Oh, not so fast,&quot; said Ermine, &quot;you must first pay me for my
work.&quot; &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; asked the man. &quot;I am
ashamed of my dirty brown coat, which I have worn for a long time,&quot; said
the animal; &quot;you have great magic from the wand you received from the
fairy woman of the Blue Hills. I want a sleek and shining white coat that I can
wear always, for I want to be clean.&quot; The man waved his wand again and
wished for what the animal had asked him, and at once the shaggy brown coat of
Ermine was replaced by a sleek and shining white coat as spotless as the new
snow in winter. Then the animal said, &quot;I have one more condition to impose
on you. You must promise never to kill a bear's young cubs when they are still
following their mother in the summer time. You must give them a chance to grow
strong, so that they may be able to fight for their own lives.&quot; And the
man promised, placing his hand upon the wand to bind his oath. Then, when he
looked again, the wand had vanished from his hand. It had gone back through the
air to the fairy woman of the Blue Hills.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Ermine set out on
his search for Bear. The afternoon was very hot, and the forest was still, and
not a leaf or a blade of grass was stirring, and there was not a ripple on the
stream. The whole world was drowsy in the dry summer heat. But Ermine did not
feel the heat, he was in such high spirits because of his new white coat. Soon
he came upon Bear, stretched out at full length on the bank of the river,
taking his afternoon nap, as was his custom after his fat midday meal. He was
lying on his back, and his mouth was open wide, and he was snoring loudly like
a waterfall. &quot;This is your last sleep,&quot; said Ermine, creeping softly
to his side, &quot;for you are a dangerous thief; you shall snore no
more.&quot; And with a bound he jumped down Bear's throat, and in an instant
had pierced with his teeth his strong stony heart, which the arrows of the
Indians could never reach. Then as quickly as he had entered the Bear's mouth
Ermine jumped out again and ran from the place. Bear snored no more; he was
quite dead, and the land was rid of his thefts and terrors. Then Ermine went
back to the old man and told him that the deed was done; and that night was a
great feast night in the old man's home. And since that time Ermine in the
North Country has worn a sleek white coat as spotless as the new snow in
winter. And to this day the hunters in the far north will not kill, if they can
avoid it, the young Bear cubs while they are still following their mothers
through the forest. They give them a chance to grow up and grow strong, so that
they may be able to fight for their own lives, as the fairy woman of the Blue
Hills had asked.</span></p>

style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>How Rabbit Deceived Fox</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Long ago in Indian days
in Canada, when Rabbit worked for Glooskap as his forest guide, he was a great
thief. He liked most of all to steal by moonlight, and he crept quietly into
gardens and fields where Indian vegetables were growing, for he was very fond
of cabbage and lettuce and beans. Not far from his home there lived alone an
old widow woman who had no children. She could not hunt game because she was a
woman, and she had never been trained to the chase, so she kept a little garden
from which she made a good living. All day long from dawn until sunset she
toiled hard, tilling her little garden, watering her vegetables and keeping
them free from weeds. And she grew green cabbages and red carrots and yellow
beans and big fat pumpkins and Indian corn, which she traded with Indian
hunters in return for fish and meat. In this way she always had plenty of food,
and she lived very well on good fare. But Rabbit, going his rounds one day,
discovered her garden, although it was deep in the forest, and every night by
moonlight or starlight he robbed it, and grew sleek and fat from the results of
his thefts. And morning after morning the old widow woman found that many
cabbages and carrots were missing and that much harm had been done to her
plants. She had an idea that Rabbit was the pilferer, for she had heard that he
was a great thief, but she was not very sure. She watched many nights, but she
was never able to catch the robber, so stealthily did he come, and it was not
easy to see him in the shadows. So she said to herself, &quot;I will set up a
scarecrow, a figure in the shape of a little man, and I will place it at my
garden gate, and it will frighten away the robber, whoever he may be, for I
must save my vegetables or I shall starve when the cold winter comes.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She picked from the
spruce and the fir trees close by a great store of gum and balsam. This she
formed into a figure in the shape of a little man. She made two eyes from glass
beads that would shine like fire in the starlight, and a nose from a pine cone,
and hair from the corn tassels and yellow moss. Then she placed the figure at
the entrance to the garden where she knew the robber would come.
&quot;Now,&quot; she thought, &quot;I will scare away the thief.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When night fell and the
moon rose above the trees, Rabbit came along, as was his custom, to steal his
nightly meal. As he came near the garden very softly, he saw in the moonlight
what he thought was a man standing in the path by the garden gate. The moon
hung low over the forest, and there was a thin grey mist on the earth, for it
was near to autumn and the nights were already cool; and the figure of the
little man looked larger than human in the misty light, and it cast a long
black shadow like that of a giant on the grass. Rabbit was much afraid and he
trembled like an aspen leaf, but he stood quiet behind a tree and watched the
strange figure. For a long time he stood still and watched and listened. But
the strange figure did not move, and not a sound did Rabbit hear but the chirp
of a cricket. Then with great caution he came closer. But still the figure did
not move. Then his fear left him and he grew bolder, for he was very hungry,
and he could smell the vegetables and the wild honeysuckle in the still night
air. So he walked bravely up to the little dummy man and said, &quot;Get out of
my way and let me pass.&quot; But the man did not move. Then Rabbit struck the
man a sharp blow with his fist. But still the figure did not move. Rabbit's
fist stuck fast in the gum and he could not pull it away. Then he struck out
with his other fist, and it too, like the other, was held firm. &quot;I shall
kick you,&quot; said Rabbit in a rage. &quot;Take that,&quot; and he struck out
wildly with his foot. But his foot, like his fists, stuck fast. Then he kicked
with the other foot, but that too was held in the gum. Rabbit was now very
cross, and in his anger he said, &quot;Now I shall bite you,&quot; but when he
bit the little man, his teeth, like his feet and hands, stuck fast. Then he
pushed with his body with all his might, hoping to knock the little man down,
but his whole body stuck to the dummy figure.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He cried out loudly, for
he was now beside himself with fear, and the old woman, when she heard his
yells, came running out of her house. &quot;Aha!&quot; she said, &quot;so you
are the robber who has been stealing from my garden. I will rid the world of a
pilfering pest, for I will kill you this very night.&quot; Then she pulled him
away from the gum figure and put him in a strong bag and tied the mouth of the
bag with a stout string. She left the bag on the path by the garden gate and
went to look for her axe to kill Rabbit. While Rabbit lay there wondering how
he was going to escape, Fox came prowling along. He stumbled over the bag, for
he did not see it in the shadows, and he plunged forward headlong to the ground
with a great thud. He got up and rained kicks upon the bag. He was mad because
he had been tripped. He kicked poor Rabbit's back until Rabbit cried in pain.
&quot;Who are you in the bag?&quot; asked Fox when he heard the cries. &quot;I
am your friend Rabbit,&quot; was the answer. &quot;What are you doing, hiding
in the bag?&quot; asked Fox. Then Rabbit suddenly thought of a way of escape.
He knew that Fox had long been looking for a wife, but that no one would have
him as no one trusted him because his fame for treachery and slyness was so
great. &quot;I am not hiding,&quot; he said. &quot;The old woman who owns this
garden wants me to marry her grand-daughter, and when I refused to do it she
caught me and shut me up in this bag; she has just gone to bring the girl from
her house, for she is determined to make me marry her here in the moonlight
this very night. I don't want to marry her, for she is very big and fat, and I
am very small and lean.&quot; Then he cried &quot;Boo-hoo-hoo&quot; again, and
Fox said, &quot;I have been looking for a wife for a long time, and I like fat
people. Let me get into the bag in your place, and I will marry the
grand-daughter instead, for the old woman will not know me in the
shadows.&quot; And Rabbit gladly agreed. Then Fox untied the bag and let Rabbit
out and got into the bag himself, and Rabbit tied up the mouth of the bag and
hurried away as quickly as he could.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon the old woman came
back, carrying her axe. She sharpened it on a stone and said, &quot;Now I will
kill you, and you will thieve no more in my garden. A poor woman must live
untroubled by such pilfering rogues.&quot; When Fox heard these words and the
sound of the stone upon the axe, he knew that he had been deceived by Rabbit,
and when the old woman opened the bag he sprang nimbly out with a sudden bound
and was away before she could catch him. He swore by the Starlight that he
would have vengeance on Rabbit. All night long he searched for him and all the
next day, but he could not find him. At last in the gathering twilight he came
upon him in an open space in the forest, on the other side of a stream, eating
his fill of wild vegetables. Fox tried to coax him across the stream to his
side, for he himself was afraid of the water, but Rabbit would not go.
&quot;Why don't you eat some cheese?&quot; said Rabbit; &quot;there is a big
round cheese in the stream.&quot; Fox looked into the stream where Rabbit
pointed, and there he saw the reflection of the big round yellow moon. He
thought it was a round cheese, and he plunged in after it, for he was very fond
of cheese. Rabbit hoped he would be drowned, but the stream was shallow and Fox
climbed out with no cheese and with only a bad fright and a wet coat for his
pains. He was very cross, for he knew that Rabbit wished to do him harm, but he
kept his anger to himself. Rabbit was still eating contentedly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What are you
eating?&quot; said Fox, trying to hold him in talk until he could think of a
plan to catch him. &quot;I am eating good ripe fruit,&quot; said Rabbit.
&quot;I am eating Indian melons.&quot; &quot;Throw me one,&quot; said Fox, for
he was hungry. Rabbit threw him a large round wild cucumber all covered with
green prickles. &quot;Swallow it whole at a mouthful,&quot; said Rabbit;
&quot;it is very good that way.&quot; It was night and the moon shone dimly
through the trees, and Fox could not see what he was eating. He swallowed the
cucumber at one gulp, as Rabbit had told him, but the prickles stuck in his
throat and he almost choked to death. And while he was choking and spluttering
and trying to cough up the cucumber, Rabbit ran away as fast as he could,
laughing heartily to himself. Fox knew that he had been tricked again, and this
time he swore he would kill Rabbit as soon as he could find him; he resolved
that when next he saw him he would not give him a moment to live.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rabbit hid among the dry
underbrush all the next day. But when the day went down and the sky was red in
the west and the wind was very still, he sat on a log, as was his custom, and
played softly on his flute, for he was a great player on the Indian pipe. While
he was playing, Fox suddenly came upon him unawares. Rabbit saw him watching
him through the trees close at hand, but although taken by surprise, he was not
to be outdone. Fox was just about to spring upon him when Rabbit said,
&quot;The Chief's daughter has just been married to a great warrior, and the
wedding party will soon be along this way. They asked me to sit here and make
music for them with my flute as they pass by. They have promised to pay me
well, and they have invited me to the wedding feast. Come and join me and play
too, and you will be well paid, and we will go to the wedding feast together
and get good things to eat.&quot; Fox thought he would let Rabbit get the pay
he had been promised, for he was a very greedy fellow; then he would rob him
and kill him, and he would take his flute and go to the wedding feast alone,
and his vengeance would then be complete. So he decided to let his anger cool
for a little time. And he said, &quot;I have no flute, and I cannot therefore
make music; but I will sit with you to see the wedding guests go by.&quot; But
Rabbit said, &quot;Take my flute. I have another at home. I will go and get it,
for there is yet time.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So Fox took the flute
and began to play loudly, and Rabbit slipped hurriedly out of sight, pretending
to go for his Indian pipe. But he resolved to make an end of Fox, for he feared
for his own life, and instead of going home, he set the underbrush on fire. He
kindled the fire at many places all around the log on which Fox sat. Fox could
not hear the fire crackling because of the loud music of his flute, and he
thought the light was but the bright light of the moon. And the fire was almost
upon him before he knew that he was in danger. Then he tried to get away, but
on all sides his escape was stopped by the flames and he could not find an
opening. At last, in despair, to save his life, he jumped through the ring of
fire. He escaped with his life, but his eyelids were singed, and his sleek
black coat with its silver spots was scorched to a red-brown colour. He was in
great pain. He concluded that Rabbit was too clever for him to cope with, and
he resolved to leave him alone and to forego his revenge, for he was glad to
get away with his life. But he decided never again to live on friendly terms
with Rabbit. And since that night Rabbit and Fox have never hunted together.
And to the present day the descendants of this Fox have red eyes and a
red-brown coat, because Rabbit scorched their ancestor in the olden times.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once, long ago, before
the white man came to Canada, a boy was living with his parents in a village
near the ocean. As he had no brothers or sisters, he was often lonely, and he
longed for adventure and companionship. At last he decided to set out to seek
his fortune elsewhere. He was just on the point of leaving his home when it was
noised abroad one day that there had come into the land a great dragon, who was
doing great havoc and damage wherever he went. The country was in great terror,
for the dragon carried off women and children and devoured them one by one. And
what was still more mystifying, he had power to take on human form, and often
he changed himself into a man of pleasing shape and manner and came among the
people to carry out his cruel designs before they knew that he was near. The
Chief of the tribe called for volunteers to meet the dragon-man, but none of
his warriors responded. They were strong and mighty in combat with men, but it
was a different matter to encounter a dragon.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the youth heard
this dreadful story and saw the terror of his people, he said, &quot;Here is my
chance to do a great deed,&quot; for somehow he felt that he had more than
human power. So he said good-bye to his parents and set out on his adventure.
He travelled all day inland through the forest, until at evening he came to a
high hill in the centre of an open space. He said, &quot;I will climb this
hill, and perhaps I can see all the country round about me.&quot; So he went
slowly to the top. As he stood there, looking over the country which he could
see for many miles around, a man suddenly appeared beside him. He was a very
pleasant fellow, and they talked together for some time. The boy was on his
guard, but he thought, &quot;Surely this man with the good looks cannot be the
dragon,&quot; and he laughed at his suspicions and put them from his mind.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The stranger said,
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; And the boy answered, &quot;I am going far
away. I am seeking adventure in the forest for it is very lonely down by the
sea.&quot; But he did not tell him of his real errand. &quot;You may stay with
me to-night,&quot; said the new-comer. &quot;I have a very comfortable lodge
not far from here, and I will give you food.&quot; The boy was very hungry and
tired, and he went along with the man to his lodge. When they reached the house
the boy was surprised to see a great heap of bleached bones lying before the
door. But he showed no fear nor did he comment on the horrible sight. Inside
the lodge sat a very old and bent woman, tending a pot. She was stirring it
with a big stick, and the boy saw that it contained meat stew. When she placed
the stew before them, the boy said he would rather have corn, for he feared to
taste the meat. The old woman fried some corn for him, and he had a good meal.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After they had eaten,
the man went out to gather wood for the fire, and the boy sat talking to the
old woman. And she said to him, &quot;You are very young and beautiful and
innocent—the most handsome I have yet seen in this place. And because of that,
I will take pity on you and warn you of your danger. The man whom you met in
the forest and whom you supped with to-night is none other than the dragon-man
of whom you have often heard. He cannot be killed in ordinary combat, and it
would be folly for you to try. To-morrow he will kill you if you are still
here. Take these moccasins that I will give you, and in the morning when you
get up put them on your feet. With one step you will reach by their power the
hill you see in the distance. Give this piece of birch bark with the picture on
it to a man you will meet there, and he will tell you what next to do. But
remember that no matter how far you go, the dragon-man will overtake you in the
evening.&quot; The youth took the moccasins and the birch bark bearing the
mystic sign and hid them under his coat, and said, &quot;I will do as you
advise.&quot; But the woman said, &quot;There is one more condition. You must
kill me in the morning before you go, and put this robe over my body. Then the
dragon-man's spell over me will be broken, and when he leaves me, I will rouse
myself with my power back to life.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The youth went to sleep,
and the dragon-man slept all night beside him so as not to let him escape. The
next morning, when the dragon-man was out to get water from the stream some
distance away, the boy at once carried out the old woman's orders of the night
before. First of all he killed the old woman with a blow and covered her body
with a bright cloak, for he knew that when the dragon-man would leave the place
she would soon rise again. Then he put the magic moccasins on his feet and with
one great step he reached the distant hill. Here, sure enough, he met an old
man. He gave him the piece of birch bark bearing the mystic sign. The man
looked at it closely and smiled and said, &quot;So it is you I was told to wait
for. That is well, for you are indeed a comely youth.&quot; The man gave him
another pair of moccasins in exchange for those he was wearing, and another
piece of birch bark bearing another inscription. He pointed to a hill that rose
blue in the distance and said, &quot;With one step you will reach that hill.
Give this bark to a man you will meet there, and all will be well.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy put the
moccasins on his feet, and with one step he reached the distant hill. There he
met another old man, to whom he gave the birch bark. This man gave him another
pair of moccasins and a large maple leaf bearing a strange symbol, and told him
to go to another spot, where he would receive final instructions. He did as he
was told, and here he met a very old man, who said, &quot;Down yonder there is
a stream. Go towards it and walk straight into it, as if you were on dry
ground. But do not look at the water. Take this piece of birch bark bearing
these magic figures, and it will change you into whatever you wish, and it will
keep you from harm.&quot; The boy took the bark and did as he was told, and
soon found himself on the opposite bank of the stream. He followed the stream
for some distance, and at evening he came to a lake. As he was looking about
for a warm place to pass the night, he suddenly came upon the dragon-man, now in
the form of a monster dragon, hiding behind the trees. The old woman's words
had come true, for his enemy had overtaken him before nightfall, as she had
said. There was no time to lose, so the boy waved his magic bark, and at once
he became a little fish with red fins, moving slowly in the lake.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the dragon-man saw
the little fish, he cried, &quot;Little fish of the red fins, have you seen the
youth I am looking for?&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; said the little fish,
&quot;I have seen no one; I have been asleep. But if he passes this way I will
tell you,&quot; and he moved rapidly out into the lake.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dragon-man moved
down along the bank of the lake, while the youth watched him from the water. He
met a Toad in the path, and said, &quot;Little Toad, have you seen the youth I
am looking for? If he passed this way you would surely have seen him.&quot;
&quot;I am minding my own business,&quot; answered the Toad, and he hopped away
into the moss. Then the dragon-man saw a very large fish with his head above
water, looking for flies, and he said, &quot;Have you seen the boy I am looking
for?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said the fish, &quot;you have just been talking to
him,&quot; and he laughed to himself and disappeared. The dragon-man went back
and searched everywhere for Toad, but he could not find him. As he looked he
came upon a musk-rat running along by the stream, and he said angrily,
&quot;Have you seen the person I am looking for?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the
rat. &quot;I think you are he,&quot; said the dragon-man. Then the musk-rat
began to cry bitterly and said, &quot;No, no; the boy you are looking for
passed by just now, and he stepped on the roof of my house and broke it
in.&quot; The dragon-man was deceived again. He went on and soon came upon old
Turtle splashing around in the mud. &quot;You are very old and wise,&quot; he
said, hoping to flatter him, &quot;you have surely seen the person I am looking
for.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Turtle, &quot;he is farther down the stream.
Go across the river and you will find him. But beware, for if you do not know
him when you see him, he will surely kill you.&quot; Turtle knew well that the
dragon-man would now meet his fate.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dragon-man followed
the lake till he came to the river. For greater caution, so that he might be
less easily seen, he changed himself to a Snake. Then he attempted to cross the
stream. But the youth, still in the form of a fish and still using the power of
his magic bark with the mystic sign, was swimming round and round in a circle
in the middle of the river. A rapid whirlpool arose where he swam, but it was
not visible on the surface. As the Snake approached it, he saw nothing but
clear water. He failed to recognize his enemy, and as Turtle had told him, he
swam into the whirlpool before he was aware of it, and was quickly drawn to the
bottom, where he was drowned.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The youth fished him up
and cut off his head. Then he changed back to his own form. He went to the
dragon-man's lodge to see how the old woman had fared, but she had gone with
her bright robe, and the lodge was empty. Then the youth went back to his home
and reported what he had done. And he received many rich gifts from the Chief
for his brave deed, and the land was never troubled again by dragons. But from
that time the snake family was hated because its shape had concealed the
dragon-man, and to this day an Indian will not let a snake escape with his life
if he meets one of them in his path. For they still are mindful of the
adventure of their ancestor in the old days, and they are suspicious of the
evil power the snake family secretly possess.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Long ago, when Glooskap
was the ruler of the Indians in Eastern Canada, and when the animals all worked
for him and talked like men, Wolf was one of Rabbit's enemies. On the surface
they seemed to be friends, but each was afraid of the other and each suspected
the other of treachery. Rabbit was very faithful to his work as the forest
guide who showed people the way to far places. But he was also a great
trickster, and he delighted to play pranks on every one he met. He liked more
than all to pester Wolf, for he had a hatred for his cruel ways, and he was always
able to outwit him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened that Rabbit
and Wolf lived close together, deep in the Canadian forest. Some distance from
them, in a little house, lived a poor widow woman who had only one daughter.
She was a very beautiful girl, with hair as black as the raven's wing, and with
eyes like the dark of the underwater. Rabbit and Wolf each fell in love with
her, and each in his own way sought her as his wife. Rabbit tried hard to win
her love. When he went to her house he always dressed himself in a soft brown
coat, and he put a bangle around his neck and bells upon his feet. And often he
played sweetly on his flute, hoping to charm her with his music, for he was a
great player upon the Indian pipe. And he tried to grow a moustache to hide his
split lip; but he had little success, for his whiskers would not grow thick,
and he has the thin scraggy moustache of a few hairs to this day. But no matter
what Rabbit did to adorn himself, the girl gave him cold looks, and old Wolf
seemed to be deeper in her favour, for she liked his willowy form and his sleek
and bashful ways. And poor Rabbit was sore distressed.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One fine day in the
spring-time, Rabbit came upon the girl and her mother gathering May-flowers
among the moss. He crept close to listen to their talk. He heard the mother
say, &quot;I have no stomach for little Rabbit, but Wolf pleases me well. You
must marry Wolf. They tell me he is a great hunter, and if you marry him we
shall never want for food.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Rabbit heard this
he was very sad; he determined that on no account should Wolf marry the widow's
daughter, and that he must use all his power to prevent it. That night he went
alone to the girl's house. He spoke sneeringly of Wolf, saying with a bitter
frown, &quot;Wolf is no hunter; he never catches any game because he is lazy
and has no brains; I always have to feed him to keep him from starving; he is
but a beast of burden; I always ride upon his back when I go to a far country,
for he is good for nothing else.&quot; The girl's mother wondered greatly, and
she was very startled by this news, for she did not want her daughter to marry
a good-for-nothing; but she was not sure that Rabbit spoke the truth, for she
had heard that sometimes he told great lies. So she said, &quot;If you will
ride Wolf over here I will believe you, and he shall not marry my daughter, and
you shall marry her yourself.&quot; And Rabbit went home well pleased and sure
of a happy ending to his trick.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day Rabbit
purposely met Wolf in the forest, and he said, &quot;Let us go together to see
the widow's daughter.&quot; And Wolf was glad to go. They had not gone far when
Rabbit began to cry. Then he lay down on the ground, and rolled and moaned and
rubbed his belly as if in great distress. &quot;I have a sharp pain in my
belly,&quot; he sobbed, &quot;I cannot walk any farther. If I walk I shall
surely die, and I cannot go on unless you carry me on your back.&quot; Wolf
willingly agreed, for he wanted to see the beautiful girl, and he was very
sorry for poor Rabbit in his pain; and Rabbit, laughing to himself, climbed on
Wolf's back. Wolf ran along, not feeling the load, for Rabbit was very light.
They had not gone far when Rabbit cried again and said, &quot;I cannot ride
without a saddle, for your bare back hurts me and gives me blisters.&quot; So
they borrowed a little saddle from a field by the way and put it on Wolf's
back. Soon Rabbit said, &quot;This is fine fun; let us play that you are a
horse and that I am a great rider. I should like to put a little bridle on you,
and to wear spurs on my feet and to carry a whip.&quot; And Wolf, wishing to
please Rabbit to make him forget his pain, gladly agreed. So they borrowed a
little bridle and spurs and a whip from another field near by, and did as
Rabbit asked, and together they went to the girl's home, Wolf trotting along
like a little horse, and Rabbit laughing to himself, sitting in the saddle,
with his spurs and his whip, holding the bridle reins. When they drew near the
house, Rabbit made a great noise so that the mother and her daughter might look
out to see where the shouting came from. He called loudly, &quot;Whoa,
Whoa.&quot; And the girl and her mother opened the door and looked out at them
in wonder. Then as they were looking on, Rabbit, chuckling to himself, struck
Wolf a stinging blow with his whip, and stuck his spurs deep into Wolf's sides
and called him loudly a lazy beast. Wolf jumped and plunged and kicked because
of the prick of the spurs and the sting of the whip; he was very cross, but he
said nothing.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some distance away,
Rabbit tied Wolf to a tree, saying, &quot;Stay here and I will send the girl to
you.&quot; Then he went to the house, and he said to the woman, &quot;Now you
will believe that Wolf is a beast of burden, for I have ridden here on his
back.&quot; And the woman believed him. She told him to give Wolf some corn or
grass. But Rabbit said, &quot;He doesn't eat corn or grass; he eats only fresh
meat,&quot; for he knew well that Wolf would be quite contented if he got a
good meal of meat. Then she gave him some fresh meat, which he brought to Wolf.
And Wolf was happy, and his anger disappeared, and he forgot the pain of the
spurs and the whip, and he thought it was fine fun to get a good meal so
easily. The woman promised that Rabbit should marry her daughter, and when
night fell Rabbit went home well pleased, leaving Wolf still tied to the tree.
It was so dark that Wolf did not see him leaving the house, and for a long time
he thought he was still inside, and he waited long in the starlight. At last he
grew tired waiting, for he was hungry and he was cold standing still in the
chill night air of early spring. He cut with his teeth the bridle rein that
tied him to the tree, and then he went to the woman's house. But the woman
would not let him in. She told him to go away, that she never wished to see him
again, and she called him a lazy beast of burden. He went home in great anger,
for he knew now that he had been tricked, and he swore that he would have
vengeance on Rabbit.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day Rabbit
learned from the woman that she had spurned Wolf from her door, and he knew
that Wolf realized he had been deceived. He was somewhat frightened, for he
dreaded Wolf's vengeance, and for several days he hid among the trees. Then
hunger drove him out and he went forth to look for food. One evening he entered
a garden in search of cabbage, and he was busy robbing it, when the people who
owned the garden spied him. And they said, &quot;Here is the thief who has been
stealing our vegetables. We will catch him and teach him a lesson.&quot; Before
Rabbit knew it, they were upon him, for he was eating heartily, he was so
hungry, and they caught him and bound him fast to a tree and went to get
scalding water to pour upon his back to teach him not to rob their garden
again. But while they were away Wolf came along. He, too, was very hungry, for
he had eaten no meal for many days, but he was glad when he saw Rabbit, for now
he thought he would have his revenge. Rabbit saw him at a distance, and he
resolved to try another trick on him, and to hail him as if he thought he was
still his friend. And he cried out to him, &quot;Help me, Wolf! Help me! The
people here asked me to eat up a nice little lamb, and when I refused to do it,
they tied me up to this tree, and they have gone to bring the lamb to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Wolf was too hungry to
be cautious, and he forgot all about Rabbit's tricks, for spring lamb was his
favourite food. And he said, &quot;I will eat up the little lamb,&quot; and he
smacked his lips as he spoke, and thought of the nice tender meal he would
have. Then Rabbit said, &quot;Untie me and take my place, for the people will
soon be here with the lamb.&quot; So Wolf untied him, and Rabbit in turn bound
Wolf fast to the tree, and laughing to himself because he had again outwitted
stupid Wolf, he ran rapidly away. Far off he hid behind the trees to see what
would happen. Soon the people came back, carrying the pots of scalding water. Wolf
saw them coming, and he was in high spirits, for he thought the lamb he was to
eat was in one of the pots. It was moonlight, and in the shadow of the great
tree the people could not see very clearly, and they thought Wolf was Rabbit,
still bound fast where they had left him. So they poured the scalding water on
his back and kicked him and knocked him on the head with a big stick, and they
said, &quot;Now, thief, we have taught you how dangerous it is to rob gardens
in the spring moonlight.&quot; Wolf howled with pain, for his back was
blistered and his head was sore, and Rabbit heard him, and he sat on a log and
shook with laughter because of the success of his prank.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the people untied
Wolf and let him go. He went away wearily among the trees. And he again swore
vengeance on Rabbit, and he resolved to kill him as soon as he set eyes upon
him, for he knew he had been tricked a second time. For several days he
searched for his enemy. At last, one night of bright moonlight, he came upon
Rabbit sitting in a patch of Indian tobacco plants, eating his fill and
contentedly chewing the tobacco leaves. Rabbit's mouth was full of tobacco, but
he laughed loudly when he saw Wolf's back bound in bandages because of the
blisters, and his sore head tied up in a cloth. But when he saw Wolf's angry
eyes he was frightened, and he ran away into the woods. The moon was shining in
the forest, and Wolf could catch a glimpse now and then of his brown coat among
the trees, and he chased him for a long time. Rabbit tried all his tricks to
shake him from his tracks, but without avail. At last, when Rabbit was almost
worn out, he took refuge in a hollow tree, into which he slipped through a
small hole, where Wolf could not follow him. And Wolf said, &quot;Now I have
him in my power. I will kill him; but first I must go home to get my axe to cut
down the tree and to chop off his head.&quot; Then he looked around for some
one to keep watch over the tree while he was gone, so that Rabbit could not
escape. At last he saw Owl sitting quietly on a branch near. He called to him
and said, &quot;Watch by this hole until I get back, and do not let Rabbit get
away.&quot; So Owl came down and sat by the hole and promised to keep guard
over the prisoner, and Wolf went away to look for his axe.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But Rabbit was not
caught yet; he had another trick left. After Wolf had gone away, he called to
Owl sitting by the hole, and said, &quot;Owl, come and see what a nice little
room I have here in the tree.&quot; But Owl replied, &quot;It is too dark, I
cannot see.&quot; Then Rabbit said, &quot;Open your eyes wide and put your face
close to the hole, for I have a light here and you can see easily.&quot; Owl
did as he was told, for he was a curious fellow. Rabbit had a great mouthful of
tobacco juice from the Indian tobacco leaves he had been chewing, and when Owl
put his face close to the hole he squirted the juice into Owl's eyes. Owl
screamed loudly, for his eyes were smarting and he was blinded by the juice; he
ran around the tree and stamped and shrieked and rubbed his eyes, trying to
relieve them of their pain. And while he was about it, Rabbit slipped out of
the hole and ran away, and Owl did not know he was gone.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon Wolf came back,
carrying his big sharp axe. And he said, &quot;Now I shall kill him at
last.&quot; And Owl was afraid to tell him about his sore eyes; they were still
open wide, and he could not close them. At once Wolf chopped down the hollow
tree. Then he split it open from end to end. But there was no sign of Rabbit.
Wolf then thought Owl had tricked him, and that he had helped Rabbit to escape.
But Owl said he had not. He sat with his eyes wide open, staring stupidly and
moaning and making strange noises because of his pain. Wolf thought he was
laughing at him and taunting him, for he did not know the meaning of Owl's
strange cries, and in his rage he fell to beating him over the head with his
axe-handle until poor Owl's head was swollen to a great size. And Owl cried,
&quot;Hoot, Hoot, Hoot,&quot; and his eyes stared from his swollen head even
larger than before. Then Wolf went on his way, resolved to keep away from Rabbit.
And since that time Owl has cried &quot;Hoot, Hoot, Hoot&quot; at night, for he
still remembers his pain; and his head is still swollen and bigger than that of
other birds because of the beating Wolf gave him with his axe-handle; and his
eyes are still large and they stare stupidly, and he cannot look at light, and
he is blind in the daylight because of the tobacco juice Rabbit squirted into
his eyes. And since that night Rabbit and Wolf have avoided each other, and
they have not lived in the same place, and they have never since been friends.</span></p>

two little children were living long ago on the shores of a lake surrounded by
large trees, deep in the Canadian forest. They lived very happily together, and
as game was plentiful, they wanted for nothing. As the children grew up they
became each day more beautiful and gentle, until the old women of the tribe
said, &quot;They are too good and lovely for this world; their home is surely
elsewhere in the West.&quot; Before they grew to maturity a cruel plague spread
over the land and carried them off with its ravages. Their mother was the next
to go, slowly growing weaker, and wasting away before the eyes of her husband, who
was powerless to save her.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The man was now left all
alone upon the earth. The joy of his life had gone with his wife and children,
and he went about in great loneliness and sorrow. Life was long to him and
dreary, and often he wished that he too was dead. But at last he roused himself
and said, &quot;I will go about doing good. I will spend my life helping
others, and perhaps in that way I can find peace.&quot; So he worked hard and
did all the good he could for the weaker and the poorer people of his tribe. He
was held in high esteem by all the people of the village, and in their
affection for him they all called him &quot;Grandfather.&quot; He grew to be
very old, and because of his good deeds he found great happiness. But he was
still very solitary, and the days and evenings were long and lonely, and as he
grew older and his work grew less, he found it hard to pass away the time, for
he could only sit alone and dream of his vanished youth and of his absent
friends.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day he sat thinking
by the lake. Many people of the village were around him, but as usual he sat
alone. Suddenly a large flock of birds, looking like great black clouds, came
flying from the blue hills in the distance toward the shore of the lake. They
wheeled and circled about, and hovered long over the trees, uttering strange
cries. The people had never before seen such large birds, and they were much
afraid and said, &quot;They are not ordinary creatures. They foreshadow some
strange happening.&quot; Suddenly one of the birds fluttered for an instant and
fell slowly to the earth with an arrow in its breast. No one in the village had
shot at the flock, and where the arrow had come from no man knew. The mystery
frightened the people still more, and they looked to the old man for counsel,
for they knew that he was very wise.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fallen bird lay
fluttering on the ground, seemingly in pain. The other birds circled about it
for a short time, uttering loud cries. Then they screamed and called to each
other and flew back to the distant blue hills, leaving the fallen bird behind
them with the arrow sticking in its breast. The old man was not frightened by
the sight. He said, &quot;I will go to the stricken bird; perhaps I can heal
its wound.&quot; But the people, in great fear, said, &quot;Do not go,
Grandfather, the bird will do you harm.&quot; But the old man answered,
&quot;It can do no harm to me. My work is ended and my life is almost done. My
sky is dark, for I am full of sorrow, and with me it is already the twilight of
time. I am alone in the world, for my kindred have gone. I am not afraid of death,
for to me it would be very welcome. What matters it if I should die?&quot; And
he went to the stricken bird to see if he could help it.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he went along, his
path suddenly grew dark, but as he drew nearer, a bright flame suddenly swept
down from the sky to the place where the bird was lying. There was a flash of
fire, and when the old man looked he saw that the bird had been completely
burned up. When he came to where it had lain, nothing but black ashes remained.
He stirred up the ashes with his stick, and lying in the centre he found a
large living coal of fire. As he looked at it, in a twinkling it disappeared,
and in its place was a strange little figure like a little man, no bigger than
his thumb. &quot;Hello, Grandfather,&quot; it called, &quot;do not strike me,
for I have been sent to help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who are you?&quot;

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am one of the
Little People from the distant blue hills,&quot; said the tiny boy. Then the
old man knew that the little fellow was one of the strange fairy people of the
mountains, of whom he had often heard. &quot;What do you want?&quot; he asked.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have been sent

wondered greatly, but he said nothing.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the fairy from the
blue hills said, &quot;You are old and lonely. You have done many noble deeds,
and you have always gone about bringing good to others. In that way you have
found peace. And because of your good life, I have been sent to bring you more
contentment. Your work is done, but your life is not yet ended, and you have
still a long time to dwell upon the earth. You must live out your mortal
course. You are longing always for your dead wife and children, and you are
often thinking of your youth, and with you the days are long and time hangs
heavy. But I have been sent to you with a gift that will help you to pass the
time more pleasantly.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the little man gave
him a number of small seeds and said, &quot;Plant these at once, here, in the
ashes from which I have just risen.&quot; The old man did as he was told. At
once the seeds sprouted and great leaves grew from them, and soon the place
where the bird had been burned up became a large field of Tobacco.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fairy then gave him
a large pipe and said, &quot;Dry these leaves and place them in this pipe and
smoke them. You will have great contentment, and when you have nothing to do it
will help you to pass the time away, and when no one is with you it will be a
companion. And it will bring you many dreams of the future and of the past. And
when the smoke curls upwards it will have for you many visions of those you
loved, and you will see their faces in the smoke as you sit alone in the
twilight.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old man was very
thankful for the fairy's gift. But the little man said, &quot;Teach other old
men how to use it, so that they, too, may possess it and enjoy it.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the fairy quickly
disappeared, going towards the distant blue hills, and he was never seen in the
village again. And with his pipe and his tobacco the old man went back to his
dreaming, with more contentment than before. In this way Tobacco was brought to
the Indians in the old days.</span></p>

before the Indians came to Canada, all the animals talked and worked like men.
Every year after midsummer they held a great council at which they were all
present. But it happened once in the summer before the council met, that they
all wanted to go to the sky to see what the country up there was like. None of
them could find a way to go. The oldest and wisest creature on all the earth
was Turtle. One day he prayed to the Thunder God to take him to the sky, and
his prayer was soon answered. There was a great noise, as if the earth had been
split asunder, and when the people next looked for Turtle he was nowhere to be
found. They searched everywhere without success. But that evening, when they
looked upwards, they saw him in the sky, moving about like a black cloud.
Turtle liked the sky so well that he decided to live there always and to send
his descendants, later, to the earth. And the sky-people agreed to keep him.
They asked him, &quot;Where do you want to dwell?&quot; And he answered,
&quot;I should like to dwell in the Black Cloud, in which are the ponds and
streams and lakes and springs of water, for I always dwelt near these places
when I was young.&quot; So he was allowed to have his wish. But when the Great
Council of the animals met on earth in the time of the harvest-moon, he was
always present. He came in the Black Cloud, but he always went back to the sky
after the Council was ended. And the other animals envied him his good fortune,
and they wished that they could go with him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a time the animals
were greatly distressed and angered by the rumour that a new race of creatures
was coming from far over the ocean to inhabit their land. They talked it over
very carefully, and they all thought how fortunate it would be if they could
all go to the sky with old Turtle, and live like him, free from fear and
trouble and care. But they were puzzled to know how to get there, for Turtle
had never told any of them the way.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day Deer, wandering
about alone in the forest, as was his custom, came across Rainbow, who often
built a path of many colours to the sky. And he said to Rainbow, &quot;Carry me
up to the sky, for I want to see Turtle.&quot; But Rainbow was afraid to do it,
for he wished first to ask the Thunder God for permission, and he put Deer off,
and to gain time he said, &quot;Come to me in winter, when I stay for a time on
the mountain near the lake. Then I will gladly carry you to the place where
Turtle dwells.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Throughout the long
winter months Deer looked longingly for Rainbow, but Rainbow did not come. Life
was growing harder on the earth, and the animals were in terror of the new race
that was soon to come to their land, and Deer was very timid and impatient. At
last, one day in the early summer, Rainbow came again, and Deer hastened to
meet him. &quot;Why were you false to me?&quot; he asked; &quot;I waited for
you all winter long on the mountain by the lake, but you did not come as you
promised. I want to go to the sky now, for I must see Turtle.&quot; Rainbow answered,
&quot;I cannot take you now. But some day, when there is a Fog over the lake, I
shall come back to drive it away. Come to me then, and I shall take you to the
sky and to the place where Turtle dwells. This time I will not deceive
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rainbow consulted the
Thunder God, and received permission to do as Deer wished. Soon afterwards the
Fog one day rolled in a thick bank across the lake, and Deer hurried out to
wait for Rainbow. Sure enough, Rainbow came down, as he had promised, to drive
the Fog away. He threw his arch of many colours from the lake to the blue hills
far away, and the Fog at once disappeared from the place. And he said to Deer,
who stood watching him, &quot;Now I will keep my promise. Follow my
many-coloured path over the hills and the forests and the streams, and be not
afraid, and you will soon reach Turtle's home in the sky.&quot; Deer did as he
was told, and soon he reached the sky. Turtle was glad to see him, and Deer
liked the country so well that he decided to stay for ever. And he roamed over
the sky everywhere, moving like the wind from place to place.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When midsummer had
passed and the harvest-moon had come and the Great Council again met together,
Deer was absent for the first time in his life. The animals waited long for him
to appear, for they needed his advice, but he did not come. They sent the Birds
out to find him. Black Hawk and Woodpecker and Bluejay all sought him in the
forest, but they could not find a trace of him. Then Wolf and Fox scoured the
woods far and near, but they came back and reported that he could not be found
anywhere. At last Turtle arrived at the meeting of the Great Council, as was
his custom, coming in his Black Cloud, in which were the ponds and lakes and
streams and springs of water. And Bear said, &quot;Deer is absent from the
Council meeting. Where is Deer? We cannot meet without him, for we need his
advice.&quot; And Turtle replied, &quot;Deer is in the sky. Have you not heard?
Rainbow made a wonderful pathway for him of many varied colours, and by that he
came to the sky. There he is now,&quot; and he pointed to a golden cloud
scurrying across the sky overhead.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Turtle advised that the
animals should all go to the sky to live until they could be sure that the new
race of creatures would bring them no harm. And he showed them the pathway that
Rainbow had made, stretching from the earth in wonderful colours. The animals
all agreed at the Great Council to take Turtle's advice. But they were all very
angry at Deer for leaving them without warning, for they thought that all the
animals should either stay together faithfully on the earth or go all together
to the sky. Bear showed the greatest anger and annoyance. Because of his great
strength, he had no fear of the new race that was said soon to be coming, and
he had always been inclined to look with scorn on Deer's timid and impatient
ways. &quot;Deer has forsaken us,&quot; he said; &quot;he deserted us in the
hour of our danger, and that is contrary to forest laws and to our code of
defence.&quot; And he thought to himself, &quot;I shall punish him for this
when the time comes.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the late autumn, the
time agreed upon came for the animals to leave the earth, and Rainbow again
made his bright path for them to the sky. Bear was the first to go up because
he was the leader, and because with his great weight he wanted to test the
strength of the bridge of burning colours over which they had to pass. When he
had almost reached the sky, he met Deer on the path waiting to welcome the
animals to their new home. And he said to him in anger, &quot;Why did you leave
us behind, without warning, for the land of the Turtle? Why did you desert the
Great Council? Why did you not wait until all could come together? You are a
traitor to your comrades, and you have been false to our faith.&quot; And Deer
answered, also in anger, &quot;Who are you to doubt me or my faith? None but
the Wolf may ask me why I came or question my fidelity. I will kill you for
your insolence.&quot; Deer had grown very proud since he had gone to live in
the sky, and he was no longer timid as he had been on earth. His eyes flashed
in his fury, and he arched his neck and lowered his antlered head, and rushed
madly at Bear to push him from the path.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But Bear was not afraid,
for he had often tested his strength with Deer upon the earth. His low, hoarse growls
sounded all over the sky, and he prepared to fight. They came together with a
shock. For a long time they battled, until the bridge of burning colours
trembled and the heavens shook from the force of the conflict. The animals
waiting by the lake at the end of the path looked up and saw the battle above
them. They feared the results, for they wanted neither Bear nor Deer to die. So
they sent Wolf up to the sky to put a stop to the contest. When Wolf reached
the combatants, Bear was bleeding freely, for Deer with his antlers had pierced
his neck and side. Deer, too, was bleeding where Bear's strong claws had torn a
great wound in his head. Wolf soon stopped the battle, and Bear and Deer went
away to dress their wounds. Then the other animals went up to the sky over
Rainbow's flaming path. And they decided to live in the sky and to send their
descendants back to earth when the new race of creatures should come. And they
can still sometimes be seen, like clouds hurrying across the sky, in the shape
they had on earth.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the blood of Bear
and of Deer dropped from them as they moved to the sky from the scene of their
battle along the Rainbow road. It fell freely upon the leaves of the trees
beneath them, and changed them into varied colours. And every year when autumn
comes in the north country, the leaves take on again the bright and wondrous
colours given to them by the blood of Bear and Deer when they fought on the
Rainbow path ages and ages ago. And Bear and Deer have never since been
friends, and their descendants no longer dwell together in peace, as they did
in the olden days.</span></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rabbit and the Moon-Man</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once, long ago, Rabbit
lived with his old grandmother deep in the Canadian forest, far from all other
people. He was a great hunter, and all around, far and near, he laid snares and
set traps to catch game for food. It was winter, and he caught many little
animals and birds. He brought them home daily to feed himself and his old
grandmother, and he was well pleased with his success. But after some weeks had
passed he was unable to catch any game. He always found his traps and snares
empty, although many tracks were always around them, and there were many signs
that animals were prowling about. He knew then that he was being robbed
nightly, and that a thief was pilfering his traps. It was very cold and the
snow lay deep in the forest, and Rabbit and his old grandmother were in dire
need of food. Every morning Rabbit rose very early and hurried off to his
traps, but always he found them empty, for the thief had been ahead of him. He
was greatly puzzled, for he could not think who the thief was.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last one morning,
after a new fall of snow, he found the mark of a long foot near his traps, and
he knew it was the foot of the game-robber. It was the longest foot-print he
had ever seen, long and narrow and very light, like a moonbeam. And Rabbit
said, &quot;Now I shall rise earlier in the morning, and I shall go to my traps
ahead of the thief and take my game, so that they will all be empty when he
comes.&quot; Each morning he rose earlier to catch the thief, but the man of
the long foot was always there before him, and his game was always gone. No
matter how early Rabbit got up, the thief was always ahead of him and his traps
were always empty.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So Rabbit said to his
old grandmother, &quot;The man of the long foot, who robs my traps, is always
up ahead of me, no matter how early I rise. I will make a snare from a
bow-string, and I will watch all this night, and I will surely catch him.&quot;
He made a trap from a stout bow-string and set it beside his snares, and took
the end of the bow-string some distance away to a clump of trees, behind which
he hid. He hoped that the thief would step into the trap; then he would pull
the bow-string and tie him fast to a tree. He sat very quiet, waiting for the
man of the long foot to appear. It was moonlight when he set out, but soon it
grew very dark in the forest. The Moon suddenly disappeared. But the stars were
all shining on the white snow and there were no clouds in the sky, and Rabbit
wondered what had happened to the Moon. He waited very still and a little
frightened in the starlight.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon he heard some one
coming, sneaking stealthily through the trees. Then he saw a white light which
dazzled his eyes. The light went towards the snares, until it stopped just at
the trap Rabbit had set. Then Rabbit pulled the bow-string, closed the trap as
he had hoped, and tied the string fast to a tree. He heard sounds of a
struggle, and he saw the white light move from side to side, but he knew that
he had his prisoner fast and that the man of the long foot was caught at last.
He was much afraid of the white light, and he ran home as fast as he could and
told his old grandmother that he had caught the game-robber in the trap, and
that he did not know who he was, for he was too frightened to look. And his
grandmother said, &quot;You must go back and see who it is, and tell him he
must stop robbing your snares.&quot; But Rabbit said, &quot;I do not want to go
until daylight, for the Moon has gone down and the forest is very dark.&quot;
But his grandmother said, &quot;You must go.&quot; So poor Rabbit, although he
was very frightened by what he had seen, set out again for his traps.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he drew near to his
snares he saw that the white light was still shining. It was so bright that his
eyes were dazzled and he had to stop far from it. Then he approached nearer,
but his eyes soon became very sore. There was a stream flowing beside him, and
he bathed his eyes in the cold water, but it brought him no relief, and his
eyes felt hot and red, and tears fell from them because of the dazzling light.
Then he took great handfuls of snow and threw snowballs at the light, hoping
thereby to put it out. But when the snowballs came near to the light they
melted and fell down like rain. Then, with his eyes still smarting, Rabbit in
his rage scooped up great handfuls of soft black mud from the bottom of the
stream, and forming it into balls, he threw them with all his force at the
white light. He heard them strike something with a dull thud, and he heard loud
yells from the prisoner—the man of the long foot—behind the shining light. Then
a voice came from the light, saying, &quot;Why did you snare me? Come and untie
me at once. I am the Man in the Moon. It is near to the morning, and before
dawn I must be on my way home. You have already spotted my face with mud, and
if you do not loose me at once I shall kill all your tribe.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Poor Rabbit was more
frightened than before, and he ran home and told his old grandmother what had
happened. And his grandmother was also very frightened, for she thought that no
good could come of it. And she told Rabbit to go back at once and untie the Man
in the Moon, for the night was almost spent, and the dawn would soon be
breaking. So poor Rabbit, trembling in his fear, went back to his traps. From a
great distance he cried, &quot;I will untie you if you will never again rob my
snares, and if you will never come back to earth.&quot; And the prisoner in the
trap promised, and said, &quot;I swear it by my white light.&quot; Then Rabbit
approached very carefully. He had to shut his eyes and grope his way because of
the bright light, and his lip quivered because of the great heat. At last he
rushed in and cut the bow-string snare with his teeth, and the Man in the Moon
hurried on his way, for he could already see the dawn in the East. But Rabbit
was almost blinded while he was about it, and his shoulders were badly
scorched. And ever since that time Rabbit blinks and his eyelids are pink, and
water runs from his eyes when he looks at a bright light; and his lip always quivers;
and his shoulders are yellow, even when he wears his white winter coat, because
of the great light and heat on the winter night long ago when he loosed the Man
in the Moon from the snare. And since that night the Man in the Moon has never
come back to earth. He stays at his task in the sky, lighting the forest by
night; but he still bears on his face the marks of the black mud which Rabbit
threw at him. And sometimes for several nights he goes away to a quiet place,
where he tries to wash off the mud; and then the land is dark. But he never
succeeds in cleaning himself, and when he comes back to his work the marks of
Rabbit's mud-balls are still upon his shining face.</span></p>

style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Children with One
Eye</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Two little children, a
boy and a girl, lived long ago with their widowed mother in the Canadian
forest. The woman was very poor, for her husband had long been dead and she had
to work very hard to provide food for herself and her children. Often she had
to go far from home in search of fish and game, and at times she was absent for
many days. When she went on these long journeys she left her children behind
her, and thus they were allowed to grow up with very little oversight or
discipline or care. They soon became very unruly because they were so often
left to have their own way, and when their mother returned from her hunting
trips she frequently found that they would not obey her, and that they did
pretty much as they pleased. As they grew older they became more headstrong and
disobedient, and their mother could do very little to control them. And she
said, &quot;Some day they will suffer for their waywardness.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day the woman went
to visit a neighbour not far away. She left a large pot of bear-fat boiling on
the fire. And she said to the children, &quot;Do not meddle with the pot while
I am gone, for the fat may harm you if it catches fire.&quot; But she was not
gone long when the boy said to the girl as they played around the pot,
&quot;Let us see if the fat will burn.&quot; So they took a burning stick of
wood and dropped it into the fat, and stood looking into the large pot to see
what would happen. The fat sputtered for an instant; then there was a sudden
flash, and a tongue of flame shot upwards from the pot into the faces of the
children. Their hair was burned to a crisp and their faces were scorched, and
they ran from the house crying with pain. But when they reached the outer air,
they found that they could not see, for the fire had blinded their eyes. So
they stumbled around in darkness, crying loudly for help. But no help came.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When their mother came
home she tried every remedy she thought might restore their sight. But all her
medicine was unavailing, and she said, &quot;You will always be blind. That is
the punishment for your disobedience.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the children lived in
darkness for a long time. But they were no longer headstrong and unruly, and
although they could no longer see, they were less trouble to their mother than
they were when they had their sight, for they did not now refuse to do her
bidding.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day, when their
mother was far away hunting in the forest, an old woman came along and asked
the children for food. And they brought good food to her as she sat before the
door. After she had eaten, she said, &quot;You are blind, but I can help you,
for I am from the Land of the Little People. I cannot give you four eyes, but I
will give you one eye between you. You can each use it at different times, and
it will be better than no sight at all. But handle it with great care and do
not leave it lying on the ground.&quot; Then she gave them an eye which she
took from her pocket, and disappeared. So they used the one eye between them,
and when the boy had the eye and the girl wished to see anything, she would
say, &quot;Give me the eye,&quot; and her brother would carefully pass it to
her. When their mother came home she was very glad when she found that they had
now some means of sight. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day when their
mother was away again, the boy went into the forest with his bow and arrows. He
carried the eye with him. He had not gone far when he saw a fat young deer,
which he killed. The deer was too heavy for him to carry home alone. So he
said, &quot;I will go and get my sister, and we shall cut it up and put it in a
basket and carry it home together.&quot; He went home and told his sister of
his good fortune, and he led her to where the deer lay, and they began to cut
up the body. But they had forgotten to bring a basket or a bag. He called to
his sister saying, &quot;You must weave a basket into which we can put the meat
to carry it home.&quot; And his sister said, &quot;How can I make a basket when
I cannot see? If I am to weave a basket, I must have the eye.&quot; The boy
brought the eye to her and she made a large basket from green twigs.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When she had finished
making the basket the boy said, &quot;I must finish cutting up the meat. Give
me the eye.&quot; So she brought him the eye, and he proceeded to chop up the
meat and to put it in the basket. Then he said, &quot;Why can we not have a
meal here? I am very hungry.&quot; His sister agreed that this was a good idea,
and he said, &quot;You cook the meal while I pack the meat.&quot; The girl made
a fire, but she was afraid she would burn the meat, so she said, &quot;I cannot
see to cook. I must have the eye.&quot; By this time her brother had finished
packing the meat into the basket, and he brought her the eye and she went on
with her cooking. The fire was low and she said, &quot;I must have some dry
wood. Bring me some dry pine.&quot; The boy wandered off into the forest in
search of wood, but he had not gone far when he stumbled over a log and fell to
the ground. He called to his sister in anger, saying, &quot;You always want the
eye for yourself. How can I gather dry pine when I cannot see? Give me the eye
at once.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His sister ran to him
and helped him up and gave him the eye. She found her way back to the fire, but
as she reached it she smelled the meat burning on the spit. She shouted,
&quot;The meat is burning and our dinner will be spoiled. Give me the eye at
once, so that I may see if the meat is cooked.&quot; The boy was some distance
away, and in his anger he threw the eye to her, saying, &quot;Find it. I am not
going to walk to you with it if you are too lazy to come and get it.&quot; The
eye fell to the ground between them, and neither of them knew where it lay.
They groped for it among the dead leaves, but as they searched for it, a
wood-pecker, watching from a branch of a tree near by, swooped suddenly down
and gobbled it up and flew away.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As they were still
searching for it, the old woman who had given it to them came along. She had
been hiding among the trees, and she had seen the wood-pecker flying away with
her gift. She said, &quot;Where is the eye I gave you?&quot; &quot;It dropped
from my head,&quot; answered the boy, &quot;and I cannot find it in the
grass.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said the girl, &quot;it dropped from his head,
and we cannot find it.&quot; &quot;You have lied to me,&quot; said the old
woman, &quot;and you have disobeyed, and for that I shall punish you.&quot; And
with her magic power she changed the boy into a mole and the girl into a bat,
and said, &quot;Now live blind upon the earth, with only your sense of sound to
guide you.&quot; At once the boy and the girl were changed. And so the Mole and
the Bat appeared upon the earth.</span></p>

Feathers</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once long ago, when the
Blackfeet Indians dwelt on the Canadian plains, there was a great famine in all
the land. For many months no buffaloes were killed, and there was no meat to be
had at any price. One by one the old people dropped off because of a lack of
food, and the young children died early because there was no nourishment, and
there was great sorrow everywhere. Only the strong women and the stronger
warriors remained alive, but even they gradually grew weaker because of the
pinch of the hunger sent into the land by famine. At last the Chief of the
tribe prayed that the Great Chieftain of the Indians might come into his territory
to tell the people what to do to save themselves. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Great Chief was at
that time far away in the south country where the warm winds were blowing and
the flowers were blooming. But one night he heard the Chief's prayer borne to
him on the winds, and he hastened northward, for he knew that his people on the
plains were somehow in dire distress. Soon he arrived at the village of the
hungry tribe. &quot;Who has called me here?&quot; he asked. &quot;It was
I,&quot; answered the Chief. &quot;My people are all starving because there are
no buffaloes in the country, and if you had not come we should soon have all
perished.&quot; Then the Great Chief looked upon his people and he noticed that
the old folks and the little children had disappeared; only a few children were
left and they had pinched cheeks and sunken eyes. And he took pity on them and
said, &quot;There is a great thief not far distant. He is probably a wicked
giant, and he has driven all the buffaloes away. But I will find him and soon
you shall have food.&quot; And the people were all comforted, for they knew
that the Great Chief would keep his word.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the Chief took with
him the young Chief's son and set out on his quest. The people wanted to go
with him, but he said, &quot;No! We shall go alone. It is a dangerous duty, and
it is better that, if need be, two should die in the attempt, than that all
should perish.&quot; They journeyed westwards across the prairies towards the
Great Water in the West, and as they went, the youth prayed to the Sun and the
Moon and the Morning Star to send them success. Soon they came to the rolling
foot-hills covered with sweet-grass and scrubby pine. But still they saw no
signs of buffalo. At last they reached a narrow stream, on the bank of which
they saw a house with smoke coming from the chimney. &quot;There is the cause
of all our troubles,&quot; said the Chief. &quot;In that house dwells the giant
Buffalo-thief and his wife. They have driven all the animals from the prairies
until not one is left. My magic power tells me it is so!&quot; Then by his
magic power he changed his companion into a sharp-pointed straight stick, while
he himself took the shape of a dog, and they lay on the ground and waited.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon the giant and his
wife and their little son came along. The boy patted the dog on the head, and
said, &quot;See what a nice dog I have found. He must be lost. May I take him
home?&quot; His father said, &quot;No, I do not like his looks. Do not touch
him.&quot; The boy cried bitterly, for he had long hoped for a dog of his own,
and his mother pleaded for him so hard that at last the giant father said,
&quot;Oh, very well. Have your own way, but no good can come of it.&quot; The
woman picked up the stick and said, &quot;I will take this nice straight stick
along with me. I can dig roots with it to make medicine.&quot; So they all went
to the giant's house, the giant frowning angrily, the woman carrying the stick,
and the boy leading the dog.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning the
giant went out and soon came back with a fat young buffalo, all skinned and
ready for cooking. They roasted it on a spit over the fire and had a good meal.
The boy fed some meat to the dog, but his father, when he saw what the boy was
doing, beat him soundly, and said, &quot;Have I not told you the dog is an evil
thing? You must not disobey me.&quot; But again the woman pleaded for her boy,
and the dog was fed. That night when all the world was asleep, the dog and the
stick changed back to their human form and had a good supper of what was left
of the buffalo-meat. And the Chief said to the youth, &quot;The giant is the
Buffalo-thief who keeps the herds from coming to the prairies. It is useless to
kill him until we have found where he has hidden them.&quot; So they changed
back to the shapes of dog and stick and went to sleep.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning the
woman and her boy set off to the forest near the mountain, to gather berries
and to dig up medicine roots. They took the dog and the stick with them. At
noon, after they had worked for some time, they sat down to have their
luncheon. The woman threw the stick down on the ground, and the boy let the dog
run away among the shrubs. The dog wandered to the side of the mountain. There
he found an opening like the mouth of a cave. Peering into the place he saw
many buffaloes within, and he knew that at last he had found the hiding place
of the giant's plunder. He went back to the woman and the boy and began to
bark. This was the signal agreed on with his companion. The woman and her son
thought he was barking at a bird, and they laughed at his capers as he jumped
about. But he was in reality calling to his comrade. The stick understood the
call and wiggled like a snake through the underbrush to the dog's side, unseen
by the boy and his mother. They then entered the large cave in the side of the
mountain, and there they found a great herd of buffaloes—all the buffaloes that
had been driven from the prairies. The dog barked at them and snapped at their
heels, and the stick beat them, and they began to drive them quickly out of the
cavern and eastward toward the plains. But they still kept the shape of dog and
stick. When evening came, and it was time for the boy and his mother to go
home, the boy searched for the dog and the woman looked for her stick, but they
could not find them, and they had to go home without them.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Just as the woman and
her son reached their house on the bank of the river, the giant-thief was
coming home too. He chanced to look to the east, and there he saw, far away,
many buffaloes running towards the foot-hills where the sweet-grass grew. He
was very angry, and he cried loudly to his son, &quot;Where is the dog? Where
is the dog?&quot; &quot;I lost him in the underbrush,&quot; said the boy;
&quot;he chased a bird and did not come back.&quot; &quot;It was not a bird he
chased,&quot; said the giant; &quot;it was one of my buffaloes. I told you he
was an evil thing and not to touch him, but you and your mother would have your
way. Now my buffaloes are all gone.&quot; He gnashed his teeth in a great rage,
and rushed off to the hidden cave to see if any buffaloes were left, crying as
he went, &quot;I will kill the dog if I find him.&quot; When he reached the
cave the Chief and the youth, still in the form of a dog and a stick, were just
rounding up the last of the buffaloes. The giant rushed at them to kill the dog
and to break the stick, but they sprang upon an old buffalo and hid in his long
hair and, clinging on tightly, the dog bit the buffalo until the old animal
plunged and roared and rushed from the cave, bearing the Chief and the youth
concealed on his back. He galloped eastward until he reached the herd far away
on the prairie, leaving the giant far behind to make the best of his anger.
Then the Chief and the brave youth took their old form of men, and in high
spirits they drove the herd of buffaloes back to their hungry people waiting
patiently on the plains.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The people were very
pleased to see the Great Chief and the youth returning to the village with the
great herd of fat buffaloes, for they knew now that the famine was ended. But
as they drove the animals into a great fenced enclosure, a large grey bird flew
over their heads and swooped down upon them and pecked at them with its bill,
and tried to frighten them and drive them away. The Great Chief knew by his
magic power that the grey bird was none other than the giant-thief who had
stolen the buffaloes, and who had changed himself into a bird to fly across the
prairies in pursuit of them. Then the Chief changed himself into an otter and
lay down on the bank of the stream, pretending to be dead. The grey bird flew
down upon him, for he thought he would have a good meal of fat otter. But the
Chief seized him by the leg, and changing back to his own form, he bore him in
triumph to his camp. He tied him up fast to the smoke-hole of his tent and made
a great fire inside. The giant cried, &quot;Spare me, spare me, and I shall
never do you more harm.&quot; But the Chief left him on the tent pole all night
long while the black smoke from the fire poured out around him. In the morning
his feathers were all black. Then the Chief let him down. And he said,
&quot;You may go now, but you will never be able to resume your former shape.
You will henceforth be a raven, a bird of ill-omen upon the earth, an outlaw
and a brigand among the birds, despised among men because of your thefts. And
you will always have to steal and to hunt hard for your food.&quot; And to this
day the feathers of the raven are black, and he is a bird of ill-omen upon the
earth because of his encounter with the Great Chieftain long ago.</span></p>

Thoughts</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A poor widow woman once
lived near the sea in Eastern Canada. Her husband had been drowned catching
fish one stormy day far off the coast, and her little boy was now her only
means of support. He had no brothers or sisters, and he and his mother, because
they lived alone, were always good comrades. Although he was very young and
small, he was very strong, and he could catch fish and game like a man. Every
day he brought home food to his mother, and they were never in want.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it happened that the
Great Eagle who made the Winds in these parts became very angry because he was
not given enough to eat. He went screaming through the land in search of food,
but no food could he find. And he said, &quot;If the people will not give me
food, I will take care that they get no food for themselves, and when I grow
very hungry I shall eat up all the little children in the land. For my young
ones must have nourishment too.&quot; So he tossed the waters about with the
wind of his great wings, and he bent the trees and flattened the corn, and for
days he made such a hurly-burly on the earth that the people stayed indoors,
and they were afraid to come out in search of food.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last the boy and his
mother became very hungry. And the boy said, &quot;I must go and find food, for
there is not a crumb left in the house. We cannot wait longer.&quot; And he
said to his mother, &quot;I know where a fat young beaver lives in his house of
reeds on the bank of the stream near the sea. I shall go and kill him, and his
flesh will feed us for many days.&quot; His mother did not want him to make
this hazardous journey, for the Great Eagle was still in the land. But he said
to her, &quot;You must think of me always when I am gone, and I will think of
you, and while we keep each other in our memories I shall come to no
harm.&quot; So, taking his long hunting knife, he set out for the beaver's home
in his house of reeds on the bank of the stream near the sea. He reached the
place without mishap and there he found Beaver fast asleep. He soon killed him
and slung him over his shoulder and started back to his mother's house. &quot;A
good fat load I have here,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;and we shall now
have many a good dinner of roast beaver-meat.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But as he went along
with his load on his back the Great Eagle spied him from a distance and swooped
down upon him without warning. Before he could strike with his knife, the Eagle
caught him by the shoulders and soared away, holding him in a mighty grip with
the beaver still on his back. The boy tried to plunge his knife into the
Eagle's breast, but the feathers were too thick and tough, and he was not
strong enough to drive the knife through them. He could do nothing but make the
best of his sorry plight. &quot;Surely I can think of a way of escape,&quot; he
said to himself, &quot;and my mother's thoughts will be with me to help
me.&quot; Soon the Eagle arrived at his home. It was built on a high cliff
overlooking the sea, hundreds of feet above the beach, where even the sound of
the surf rolling in from afar could not reach it. There were many young birds
in the nest, all clamouring for food. Great Eagle threw the boy to the side of
the nest and told him to stay there. And he said, &quot;I shall first eat the
beaver, and after he is all eaten up we shall have a good fat meal from
you.&quot; Then he picked the beaver to pieces and fed part of it to his young
ones.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For some days the boy
lay in terror in the nest, trying to think of a way of escape. Birds flew high
over his head, and far out on the ocean he could see great ships going by. But
no help came to him, and he thought that death would soon be upon him. And his
mother sat at home waiting for him to return, but day after day passed and
still he did not come. She thought he must surely be in great danger, or that
perhaps he was already dead. One day, as she was weeping, thinking of her lost
boy, an old woman came along. &quot;Why do you cry?&quot; she asked. And the
weeping woman said, &quot;My boy has been away for many days. I know that harm
has come upon him. The men of my tribe have gone in search of him, and they
will kill whatever holds him a prisoner, but I fear he will never come back
alive.&quot; And the old woman said, &quot;Little good the men of your tribe
can do you! You must aid him with your thoughts, for material things are vain.
I will help you, for I have been given great power by the Little People of the
Hills.&quot; So the woman used her thoughts and her wishes to bring back her
boy.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That night the boy
noticed that the beaver had all been eaten up and that not a morsel remained.
He knew that unless he could save himself at once he would surely die on the
morrow. The Great Eagle, he knew, would swoop down upon him and kill him with a
blow of his powerful beak and claws. But when the boy slept, he saw his mother
in his slumber. And she said to him, &quot;To-morrow when Great Eagle goes from
the nest, brace your knife, point upwards, against the rock. When he swoops
down to kill you his breast will strike the knife, and he will be pierced to
death. You are not strong enough to cut through his feathers with your knife,
but he is powerful enough to destroy himself.&quot; The next morning when Great
Eagle went out, the boy did as the vision of the night had told him. He braced
his sharp hunting-knife, point upwards, against the rock and sat still and
waited. Then he heard the young eagles making a great noise and crying loudly
for their breakfast. He knew that his hour had come. Soon the Great Eagle,
hearing the screams of his young ones, came flying back to the nest to kill the
boy. He circled around above him with loud cries and then with great force
swooped down upon him, hoping to kill him with his beak and claws. But instead,
he struck the blade braced upwards against the rock. The knife pierced far into
his breast, and with a loud scream he rolled over dead into the nest. The boy
then killed the young eagles, and he knew that now for a time he was safe.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But he did not know how
to get down from the Eagle's nest, for it jutted out like a shelf far over the
beach, and behind it was a wall of rock around which he could not climb. He had
no means of making a ladder, and his cries would not be heard upon the beach
because of the constant roaring of the surf. He thought he would surely starve
to death, and that night he cried himself to sleep. But in the night he again
saw his mother in his slumbers. And she said, &quot;You are a foolish boy. Why
do you not use the thoughts I send you? To-morrow skin the eagle and crawl
inside the skin. If the wide wings can hold the Eagle in the air they can
likewise hold you. Drop off from the cliff and you will land safely on the
beach.&quot; The next day the boy did as the vision of the night had told him.
He carefully skinned the Great Eagle. Then he crawled inside the skin and thrust
his arms through the skin just above the wings, so that his extended arms would
hold the wings straight out beneath them. Then he prepared to drop down. But
when he looked over the cliff, he was very frightened, for the sight made him
dizzy. On the beach, men looked like flies, they were so far away. But he
remembered the promise made to him in his slumbers. So he pushed himself from
the cliff and dropped down. The wings of Great Eagle let him fall gently
through the air and he landed safely and unhurt upon the beach. He crawled out
of the skin and set out for his home. It was a long journey, for Great Eagle
had carried him far away, but towards evening he reached his home safely, and
his mother received him with great gladness.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy began to boast
of his adventure, and he told how he had killed Great Eagle and how he had
dropped down unscathed from the cliff. He spoke of himself with great pride and
of his strength and his shrewdness. But the old woman from the Land of the
Little People, the fairies of the hills, who was still present with his mother,
said, &quot;Oh, vain boy, do not think so highly of yourself. Your strength is
nothing; your shrewdness is nothing. It was not these things that saved you,
but it was the strength of our thoughts. These alone endure and succeed when
all else fails. I have taught you the uselessness of all material things, which
in the end are but as ashes or as dust. Our thoughts alone can help us in the
end, for they alone are eternal.&quot; And the boy listened and wondered at what
the old woman from the Land of Little People had said, but he boasted of his
strength no more.</span></p>

Giants</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once long ago, before
the white man came to Canada, an orphan boy was living alone with his uncle. He
was not very happy, for he had to work very hard, and tasks more fitted for a
man's shoulders than for a boy's were often placed upon him. When his parents
died and left him without brother or sister, his uncle took him to his own home
because there was no one else to take care of him. But he treated him very
cruelly and often he wished to get rid of him. It mattered not how well the boy
did his work or how many fish and animals he caught, his uncle was never
satisfied, and often he beat the boy harshly and with little cause. The boy
would have run away but he did not know where to go, and he feared to wander
alone in the dark forest. So he decided to endure his hardships as best he
could.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it happened that in
a distant village near the sea there lived a Chief who was noted far and wide
for his cruelty. He had a wicked temper, and he was known to have put many
people to death for no reason whatsoever. More than all else, he hated
boastfulness and he had scanty patience with anyone who was vain of his own
strength. He pledged himself always to humble the proud and to debase the
haughty. The boy's uncle had heard of this wicked ruler, and he said,
&quot;Here is a chance for me to get rid of the boy. I will tell lies about him
to the Chief.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It chanced just at this
time that three giants came into the Chief's territory. Where they came from,
no man knew, but they dwelt in a large cave near the sea, and they caused great
havoc and destruction in all the land. They ate up great stores of food, and
all the little children they could lay their hands on. The Chief used every
means to get rid of the giants, but without success. Night after night his best
warriors went to the cave by the ocean to seek out the giants, but not a man
returned. A piece of birch bark bearing a picture of a warrior with an arrow in
his heart, found the next day at the Chief's door, always told him of the
warrior's fate. And the giants continued their cruel work, for no one could
stop them.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon all the country was
in great terror. The Chief wondered greatly what was to be done. At last he
thought, &quot;I will give my daughter to the man who can rid me of these
pests.&quot; His daughter was his only child and she was very beautiful, and he
knew that many suitors would now appear to seek her hand, for although the task
was dangerous, the prize was worth while. When the wicked uncle in the distant
village heard of it, he thought, &quot;Now I can get rid of the boy, for I will
tell the Chief that the boy says he can kill the giants.&quot; So taking his
nephew with him he went to the Chief's house and begged to see him. &quot;Oh,
Chief,&quot; he said, &quot;I have a boy who boasts that before many days have
passed he can free your land from the giants.&quot; And the Chief said,
&quot;Bring him to me.&quot; The man said, &quot;Here he is.&quot; The Chief
was surprised when he saw the small boy, and he said, &quot;You have promised
that you can rid my land of giants. Now we shall see if you can do it. If you
succeed you may have my daughter. If you fail, you will die. If you escape from
the giants, I will kill you myself. I hate vain boasters, and they shall not
live in my land.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy went and sat by
the ocean, and cried as hard as he could. He thought that he would surely die,
for he was very small and he had no means of killing the giants. But as he sat
there an old woman came along. She came quietly and quickly out of the grey
mist of the sea. And she said, &quot;Why are you crying?&quot; And the boy
said, &quot;I am crying because I am forced to attack the giants in the cave,
and if I cannot kill them I shall surely die,&quot; and he cried louder than
before. But the old woman, who was the good fairy of the sea, said, &quot;Take
this bag and this knife and these three little stones that I will give you, and
when you go to-night to the giants' cave, use them as I tell you and all will
be well.&quot; She gave him three small white stones and a small knife, and a
bag like the bladder of a bear, and she taught him their use. Then she
disappeared into the grey mist that hung low on the ocean and the boy never saw
her again.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy lay down on the
sand and went to sleep. When he awoke, the moon was shining, and far along the
coast in the bright light he could see an opening in the rocks which he knew
was the entrance to the giants' cave. Taking his bag and his knife and the
three little stones, he approached it cautiously with a trembling heart. When
he reached the mouth of the cave he could hear the giants snoring inside, all
making different noises, louder than the roar of the sea. Then he remembered
the old woman's instructions. He tied the bag inside his coat so that the mouth
of it was close to his chin. Then he took one of the stones from his pocket. At
once it grew to immense size, so heavy that the boy could scarcely hold it. He
threw it at the biggest giant with great force, and it hit him squarely on the
head. The giant sat up staring wildly and rubbing his brow. He kicked his
younger brother, who was lying beside him, and said in great anger, &quot;Why
did you strike me?&quot; &quot;I did not strike you,&quot; said his brother.
&quot;You struck me on the head while I slept,&quot; said the giant, &quot;and
if you do it again I will kill you.&quot; Then they went to sleep again.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the boy heard them
snoring loudly again, he took a second stone from his pocket. At once it grew
great in size and the boy hurled it with great force at the biggest giant.
Again the giant sat up staring wildly and rubbing his head. But this time he
did not speak. He grasped his axe, which was lying beside him, and killed his
brother with a blow. Then he went to sleep again. When the boy heard him
snoring, he took the third stone from his pocket. At once it grew to great size
and weight, and he hurled it with all his force at the giant. Again the giant
sat up with great staring eyes, rubbing the lump on his head. He was now in a
great rage. &quot;My brothers have plotted to kill me,&quot; he yelled, and
seizing his axe he killed his remaining brother with a blow. Then he went to
sleep, and the boy slipped from the cave, first gathering up the three stones,
which were now of their usual small size.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning when
the giant went to get water from the stream, the boy hid in the trees and began
to cry loudly. The giant soon discovered him and asked, &quot;Why are you
crying?&quot; &quot;I have lost my way,&quot; said the boy, &quot;my parents
have gone and left me. Please take me into your service, for I would like to
work for such a kind handsome man, and I can do many things.&quot; The giant
was flattered by what the boy said, and although he liked to eat little
children, he thought, &quot;Now that I am alone, I ought to have a companion,
so I will spare the boy's life and make him my servant.&quot; And he took the
boy back to his cave, and said, &quot;Cook my dinner before I come home. Make
some good stew, for I shall be very hungry.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the giant went into
the forest the boy prepared the evening meal. He cut up a great store of deer
meat and put it in a large pot bigger than a hogshead, and made a good meat
stew. When the giant came home in the evening he was very hungry, and he was
well pleased to see the big pot filled with his favourite food. He seated
himself on one side of the pot, and the boy seated himself on the other side,
and they dipped their spoons into the big dish. And the boy said, &quot;We must
eat it all up so that I can clean the pot well and ready for the corn mush we
will have for breakfast.&quot; The stew was very hot, and to cool it before he
ate it the giant blew his breath on what he dipped out. But the boy poured his
own share into the bag under his coat, and said, &quot;Why can't you eat hot
food—a big man like you? In my country men never stop to cool their stew with
their breath.&quot; Now the giant could not see very well, for his eyesight was
not very good, and the cave was dark, and he did not notice the boy putting the
stew in the bag so quickly. He thought the boy was eating it. And he was shamed
by the boy's taunts because he was so much larger than the boy, so he ate up
the hot stew at once in great gulps and burned his throat badly. But he was too
proud to stop or to complain.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they had eaten half
the potful, the giant said, &quot;I am full. I think I have had enough.&quot;
&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said the boy, &quot;you must show that you like my
cooking. In my country men eat much more than that,&quot; and he kept on
eating. The giant was not to be outdone by a boy, so he fell to eating again,
and they did not stop until they had consumed the whole potful of stew. But the
boy had poured his share into the bag and when they had finished he was swelled
out to an immense size. The giant could scarcely move, he had eaten so much,
and he said, &quot;I have eaten too much; I feel very full, and I have a great
pain in my belly.&quot; And the boy said, &quot;I do not feel very comfortable
myself, but I have a way to cure pains.&quot; So saying he took his little
knife and thrust it gently into the side of the bag and the stew oozed out and
he was soon back to his normal size. The giant wondered greatly at the sight,
but the boy said, &quot;It is a way they have in my country after they have had
a great feast.&quot; &quot;Does the knife not hurt?&quot; asked the giant.
&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said the boy, &quot;it brings great relief.&quot;
&quot;My throat is very sore,&quot; said the giant, for the hot stew had burned
him. &quot;You will soon feel better,&quot; said the boy, &quot;if you will do
as I have done.&quot; The giant hesitated to do this, but soon he felt so
uncomfortable that he could bear it no longer. He saw that the boy was feeling
quite well. So he took his long knife and plunged it into his stomach.
&quot;Strike hard,&quot; said the boy, &quot;or it will do you no good.&quot;
The giant plunged the knife into the hilt, and in an instant he fell dead.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the boy took the
stones and the bag and the knife which the Woman of the Mist had given him and
went and told the Chief what he had done. The Chief sent his messengers to the
cave to make sure that the boy spoke the truth. Sure enough, they found the
three giants lying dead. When they told the Chief what they had seen, he said
to the boy, &quot;You may have my daughter as your wife.&quot; But the boy
said, &quot;I do not want your daughter. She is too old and fat. I want only
traps to catch fish and game.&quot; So the Chief gave the boy many good traps,
and he went into a far country to hunt game, and there he lived happily by
himself. And his wicked uncle never saw him again. But the land was troubled no
more by giants, because of the boy's great deeds.</span></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Youth and the
Dog-Dance</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once long ago, when the
Indians dwelt in the country in the north-west, a youth went far away from his
native village to catch birds. His people lived near a lake where only small
birds nested, and as he wanted large and bright-coloured feathers for his
arrows and his bonnet he had to go far into the forest, where larger birds of
brilliant plumage lived. When he reached the Land of Many Feathers far in the
north country, he dug a pit on the top of a high hill. Then he covered the pit
with poles and over the poles he spread grass and leaves so that the place
looked like the earth around it. He put meat and corn on the grass, and tied
the food to the poles so that the birds could not carry it away. Then he
climbed down into the pit and waited for the birds to come, when he could reach
up and catch them by the feet and kill them.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All day long and far
into the night the youth waited for birds, but no birds came. Towards morning
he heard a distant sound like that of a partridge drumming. But the sound did
not come nearer. The next night, as the youth watched and waited in the pit, he
heard the same sound, and he said, &quot;I will see where the noise comes from
and I will discover the cause, for it is not a partridge, and it is very
strange.&quot; So he climbed out of the pit and went in the direction of the
sound. He walked along rapidly through the forest until he came at dawn to the
shore of a large lake. The drumming came from somewhere in the lake, but as he
stood listening to it, the sound suddenly stopped. The next night the youth
heard the drumming louder than before. Again he went to the lake. The sound was
again distinct as it rose from the water, and when he looked he saw great
numbers of birds and animals swimming in the lake in the moonlight. But there
was no explanation of the strange sound. As he sat watching the animals and
birds, he prayed to his guardian spirit to tell him the cause of the drumming.
Soon an old man came along. He was old and bent and wrinkled, but his eyes were
kind. The youth gave him some tobacco and they sat down together on the edge of
the lake and watched the swimmers in the dim light, and smoked their pipes.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What are you doing
here?&quot; asked the old man. &quot;I am trying to learn the cause of the
strange drumming,&quot; said the youth. &quot;You do well indeed to seek
it,&quot; said the old man, &quot;and to seek to know the cause of all things.
Only in that way will you be great and wise. But remember there are some things
the cause of which you can never find.&quot; &quot;Where have you come
from?&quot; said the boy. &quot;Oh,&quot; said the man, &quot;I lived once upon
a time like you in the Country of Fancy where great Dreams dwell, and indeed I
live there still, but your dreams are all of the future while mine are of the
past. But some day you too will change and your thoughts will be like
mine.&quot; &quot;Tell me the cause of the drumming,&quot; said the boy. And
the old man said, &quot;Take this wand that I will give you and wave it before
you go to sleep, and maybe you will see strange things.&quot; Then he gave the
boy a wand and disappeared into the forest and the boy never saw him again. The
boy waved the wand and fell asleep on the sand as the old man had told him.
When he awoke he found himself in a large room in the midst of many people.
Some of them were dancing gracefully, and some sat around and talked. They wore
wonderful robes of skins and feathers, of many different colours. The boy
wished he could get such feathers for his own clothes and his bonnet. But as he
looked at the people he was suddenly aware that they were none other than the
animals and birds he had seen for two nights swimming in the lake in the
moonlight. They were now changed into human form, through some strange and
miraculous power. They were very kind to the youth and treated him with great
courtesy.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last the dancing
ceased and the talking stopped, and one who seemed to be the Chief stood up at
the end of the room and said, &quot;Oh, young stranger, the Great Spirit has
heard your prayers, and because of your magic wand we have been sent to you in
these shapes. The creatures you see here are the animals and birds of the
world. I am the Dog, whom the Great Spirit loves well. I have much power, and
my power I shall give to you, and I shall always protect you and guard you. And
even if you should treat me with cruelty I shall never be unfaithful to you,
nor shall I ever be unkind. But you must take this Dance home with you and
teach it to your people and they must celebrate the Dance once a year.&quot;
Then he taught the youth the secrets of their Dance.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the youth had
learned the Dance, the Chief turned to his companions and said, &quot;My
comrades and brothers, I have taught the young stranger the secrets of the
Dance. I have given him my own power. Will you not have pity on a creature from
earth and give him some of the power of which you too are possessed?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For a long time no one
spoke, but at last Owl arose and said, &quot;I too will help him. I have power
to see far in the darkness, and to hunt by night. When he goes out at night I
will be near him and he shall see a great distance. I give him these feathers
to fasten in his hair.&quot; And the Owl gave him a bunch of feathers, which
the youth tied to his head.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Buffalo came
forward and said, &quot;I too will help him. I will give him my endurance and
my strength, and my power to trample my enemies underfoot. And I give him this
belt of tanned buffalo-hide to wear when he goes to war.&quot; And he gave the
youth a very wondrous belt to fasten around his waist.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The animals and birds,
one after the other, gave him gladly of their power. Porcupine gave him quills
with which to decorate his leather belt and his bonnet, and he said, &quot;I
too will aid you, and when you make war I will be near you. I can make my
enemies as weak as children, and they always flee when I approach, for they
fear the shooting of my quills. When you meet your foes you will always
overcome them, for I give you power as it was given to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And Bear said, &quot;I
will give you my toughness and my strength, and a strip of fur for your leather
belt and your coat. And when you are in danger, I will not be far away.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Deer said, &quot;I
give you my swiftness so that you may be fleet of foot. And when you pursue
your enemies you will always overtake them, and should you flee from them, you
will always out-run them in the race.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the birds spoke
again, and Crane said, &quot;I give you a bone from my wing to make a
war-whistle to frighten your enemies away or to summon your people to your
assistance when you need them. And I give you my wings for your
head-dress.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The giant Eagle then
spoke and said, &quot;Oh, youth, I will be with you wherever you go, and I will
give you my strength and my power in war. And even as I do, you will always see
your enemies from afar, and you can always escape them if you so desire.&quot;
And he gave him a large bunch of wonderful eagle feathers to tie in his hair as
a token of his fidelity.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And finally, Wild-Cat
said, &quot;I give you my power to crawl stealthily through the grass and the
underbrush and to spring unexpectedly on your foes and take them unawares. And
I give you too my power of hiding from my enemies.&quot; And he gave him strips
of his fur to decorate his clothing in token of his friendship.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From all the animals and
the birds the youth received power and gifts. Then he waved his magic wand and
lay down to sleep. When he awoke, he found himself on the shore of the lake,
and far in the east the dawn was breaking. But he could see farther than he had
ever seen before, and away in the distance he could make out blue hills and
smoke rising from far-off villages. And he knew that strange power was upon
him. But not a sound came from the lake, and the drumming had for ever ended.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The youth took his magic
wand and his gifts and set out for his home. And he told his people what had
happened and he taught them the secrets of the Dance which was to make them
strong and victorious in war. And among his people it became a great ceremony
and was practised for long ages, and was known as the Dog-Dance. And since that
time, the animals and birds have been friends to the Indians, and the Indians
have acquired much of their cunning and skill and power. And ever after the
night of moonlight by the lake when the youth with the magic wand received the
strange gifts, the Indians have decorated their war clothes with fur and quills
and feathers from the animals and the birds. And in the far north country, the
Dog-Dance is still held at intervals out of gratitude for the gifts, for the
Indians do not forget the promise of long ago.</span></p>

style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sparrow's Search for the
Rain</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Long ago, in a village
near the sea, many Indian people were living. Among them was a very nice old
warrior who had been given great power at his birth, and who, therefore, could
do many wonderful deeds. There was nothing that was beyond his understanding,
for he knew all things. His wife had long been dead, but he had one daughter.
She was very beautiful and gentle, and she was as nearly perfect as any woman
could be. She took no interest in frivolous things and she lived a very quiet
life, but all the people liked her well, and she was always welcome wherever
she went. Her old father was very proud of her, and he said boastfully,
&quot;She has inherited much of my wisdom, and some day she will marry a great
man.&quot; But the girl on her part had little thought of marriage or of men,
for she said they had small minds, and she would rather live alone than listen
always to their boastfulness and their foolish chatter.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon the daughter's fame
spread far and wide through the sea-coast villages, and many suitors came
seeking for her hand. But her father said, &quot;I have nothing to say. She will
make her own choice. She must please herself. For to-day children please
themselves and not their parents.&quot; And she said, &quot;I will marry only
some one who can amuse me and interest me and keep me company. I have scant
liking for dull people.&quot; One day Loon came to see her. He was very good
looking although he was somewhat tall and skinny, and his neck was a bit longer
and more scrawny than ordinary, but he wore good clothes and he had great skill
as a fisherman. He came because he thought he was very handsome, and he
believed that his good looks would win the maiden. But she had no love for
Loon, for he had not a word to say. When she talked to him he only stared, and
at last he burst out into loud and foolish laughter. Then the maiden said,
&quot;You have a small mind like the others,&quot; and in disgust she withdrew
from his presence.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Fox came in an
effort to win the maiden as his wife. And for a whole day he cut capers, and
chased his tail round and round in a circle, trying to amuse the serious girl.
But he did not succeed very well, and like Loon he departed in despair. And
many others came, but they met the same fate, and at last the girl decided to
see no more of them, but to live alone with her father. The young men of the
village were all very angry because the girl had spoken of them all so
scornfully, and often they talked among themselves of her proud and haughty
air. &quot;She calls us Scattered-Brains,&quot; said one. &quot;She says we
have small minds,&quot; said another. &quot;She must pay for these
insults,&quot; said a third. So they vowed that they would somehow break her
proud spirit and bring her sorrow because of her ideas and her decision to stay
single all her life. One of the great men of the village was Whirlwind. He
could make himself invisible, and he was often guilty of many wicked pranks. So
the young men went to him and asked his aid in humbling the pride of the
haughty maiden. As they were talking to him, they saw the girl approaching not
far off. And quite unawares, Whirlwind rushed towards her and knocked her down
in the mud and tore her hat from her head and swept it into the sea. The young
men looked on at her plight and they all laughed loudly, and the girl was very
much ashamed. She went back home and told her father what had happened, and
showed him her soiled clothes and her blown hair falling about her face. Her
father was very angry, and he said, &quot;Whirlwind must pay for this. He shall
be banished at once.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then her father went to
the Chief and made complaint against Whirlwind, and the Chief decreed that Whirlwind
must leave the village forthwith. He did not consider very carefully what the
result of this decree might be, and he acted hastily and without thought, for
he feared to differ from the wise man. So Whirlwind prepared to leave the
place. Now his best friend was Rain. Rain had been born without eyes. He was
black blind, and Whirlwind always had to lead him along wherever he wished to
go. So Rain said, &quot;If you are leaving the village, I want to leave it too,
for I cannot live here without you. I will be helpless if I have no one to lead
me.&quot; So the two set out together, Whirlwind leading old Rain along by his
side. Where they went no man knew, for they had told nobody of their
destination. They were gone for many months before the people missed them very
much. Then their absence began to be felt in all the land, for there was no
wind and there was no rain.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last the Chief
summoned a council, and the decree of banishment against Whirlwind was revoked.
The people decided to send messengers to the two wandering ones to tell them
what had happened and to bring them back. So they first sent Fox out on the
quest. Fox went through the land for many weeks, running as fast as he could
over many roads, in and out among marshy lake shores and over high wooded mountains.
He searched every cave and crevice, but he had no success. Not a leaf or a
blade of grass was stirring, and the country was all parched and the grass was
withered brown and the streams were all getting dry. At last, after a fruitless
search, he came home and shamefully confessed that his quest had failed.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the people called
on Bear to continue the search. And Bear went lumbering over the earth,
sniffing the air, and turning over logs and great rocks with his powerful
shoulders, and venturing into deep caverns. And he made many inquiries, and he
asked the Mountain Ash, &quot;Where is Whirlwind?&quot; But Mountain Ash said,
&quot;I do not know. I have not seen him for many months.&quot; And he asked
the Red Fir, and the Pine, and the Aspen, which always sees Whirlwind first,
but they were all ignorant of his whereabouts. So Bear came home and said,
&quot;Not a trace of either of them have I found.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Chief was very angry
because of the failure of Fox and Bear, but the wise man said, &quot;The
animals are useless in a quest like this. Let us try the birds. They often
succeed where the animals fail.&quot; And the Chief agreed, for the land was in
great distress. Many fishing-boats lay silent on the sea near the coast unable
to move because Whirlwind was away, and the wells and streams were all dry
because Rain was absent, and the grass and the flowers were withering to decay.
So they called the birds to their aid. The great Crane searched in the shallows
and among the reeds, thrusting his long neck into deep places, and Crow looked
among the hills, and Kingfisher flew far out to sea, but they all came back and
said, &quot;We, too, have failed. The wandering ones are nowhere on the land or
upon the sea.&quot; Then little Sparrow took up the search. Before he set out,
he plucked from his breast a small down-feather and fastened it to a stick no
bigger than a wisp of hay. He held the stick in his bill and flew off. For many
days he went towards the south-land, all the time watching the feather hanging
to the stick in his bill. But it hung there motionless. One day, after he had
travelled a great distance, he saw the down-feather moving very gently, and he
knew that Whirlwind must be not far away. He went in the direction from which
the feather was blowing. Soon he saw beneath him soft green grass and wonderful
flowers of varied colours, and trees with green leaves and many rippling
streams of running water. And he said to himself, &quot;At last I have found
the wanderers.&quot; He followed a little stream for some distance until it
ended in a cave in the hills. In front of the cave many flowers were blooming
and the grass was soft and green, and the tall grasses were nodding their heads
very gently. He knew that those he was seeking were inside, and he entered the
cave very quietly. Just beyond the door a fire was smouldering and near it lay
Rain and Whirlwind both fast asleep. Sparrow tried to wake them with his bill
and his cries, but they were sleeping too soundly. Then he took a coal from the
fire and put it on Rain's back, but it spluttered and fizzled and soon went
out. He tried another, but the same thing happened. Then he took a third coal,
and this time Rain woke up. He was much surprised to hear a stranger in the
cave, but he could not see him because he was blind. So he woke up Whirlwind to
protect him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Sparrow told them
of the great trouble in the north country and of the great hardship and sorrow
their absence had brought to the people, and of how sadly they had been missed
and of the decision of the council to call them back. And Whirlwind said,
&quot;We shall return to-morrow if we are so badly needed. You may go back and
tell your people that we are coming. We shall be there the day after you
arrive.&quot; So Sparrow, feeling very proud of his success, flew back home.
But when he arrived after many days, he went first to his own people to tell
them the good news. And the Sparrow-people all gathered together and held a
feast of celebration, and they twittered and danced and made a great hub-bub in
their excitement because Rain was coming back on the morrow. Then Sparrow went
to the Chief and said, &quot;Oh, Chief, I have found Rain and Whirlwind and
to-morrow they will be here,&quot; and he told the story of his flight to the
south and of his discovery. And the Chief said, &quot;Because of your success,
you will never be hunted for game or killed for food.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning the two
travellers who had been so long away came back to the land. Whirlwind came
first and great clouds of dust foretold his coming, and the sea dashed high
against the rocks, and the trees shrieked and tossed their heads, all dancing
gaily because of his return. When Whirlwind had passed by, Rain came along
following close, because of his blindness. For several days Rain stayed with
the people and the flowers bloomed and the grass was green again and the wells
and streams were no longer dry. And since that time Wind and Rain have never
long been absent from the Atlantic Coast. And to this day the Sparrow-people
know when Rain is coming, and to signal his approach they gather together and
twitter and hop along and make a great hub-bub, just as they did when their
ancestor found him by means of his down-feather in the olden days. But the
Indians have been true to the Chief's promise, and they will not hunt Sparrows
for game nor kill them for food or for their feathers. For they remember that
of all the birds it was old Sparrow who long ago searched successfully for the
Rain.</span></p>
