<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The
badger and the bear</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the edge of a forest there lived a large
family of badgers. In the ground their dwelling was made. Its walls and roof
were covered with rocks and straw. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Old father badger was a great hunter. He knew
well how to track the deer and buffalo. Every day he came home carrying on his
back some wild game. This kept mother badger very busy, and the baby badgers
very chubby. While the well-fed children played about, digging little
make-believe dwellings, their mother hung thin sliced meats upon long willow
racks. As fast as the meats were dried and seasoned by sun and wind, she packed
them carefully away in a large thick bag. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This bag was like a huge stiff envelope, but far
more beautiful to see, for it was painted all over with many bright colors.
These firmly tied bags of dried meat were laid upon the rocks in the walls of
the dwelling. In this way they were both useful and decorative. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day father badger did not go off for a hunt.
He stayed at home, making new arrows. His children sat about him on the ground
floor. Their small black eyes danced with delight as they watched the gay
colors painted upon the arrows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All of a sudden there was heard a heavy footfall
near the entrance way. The oval-shaped door-frame was pushed aside. In stepped
a large black foot with great big claws. Then the other clumsy foot came next.
All the while the baby badgers stared hard at the unexpected comer. After the
second foot, in peeped the head of a big black bear! His black nose was dry and
parched. Silently he entered the dwelling and sat down on the ground by the
doorway. His black eyes never left the painted bags on the rocky walls. He
guessed what was in them. He was a very hungry bear. Seeing the racks of red
meat hanging in the yard, he had come to visit the badger family. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Though he was a stranger and his strong paws and
jaws frightened the small badgers, the father said, &quot;How, how, friend!
Your lips and nose look feverish and hungry. Will you eat with us?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my friend,&quot; said the bear.
&quot;I am starved. I saw your racks of red fresh meat, and knowing your heart
is kind, I came hither. Give me meat to eat, my friend.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hereupon the mother badger took long strides
across the room, and as she had to pass in front of the strange visitor, she
said: &quot;Ah han! Allow me to pass!&quot; which was an apology. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, how!&quot; replied the bear, drawing
himself closer to the wall and crossing his shins together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Mother badger chose the most tender red meat,
and soon over a bed of coals she broiled the venison. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That day the bear had all he could eat. At
nightfall he rose, and smacking his lips together,—that is the noisy way of
saying &quot;the food was very good!&quot;—he left the badger dwelling. The
baby badgers, peeping through the door-flap after the shaggy bear, saw him
disappear into the woods near by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Day after day the crackling of twigs in the
forest told of heavy footsteps. Out would come the same black bear. He never
lifted the door-flap, but thrusting it aside entered slowly in. Always in the
same place by the entrance way he sat down with crossed shins. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His daily visits were so regular that mother
badger placed a fur rug in his place. She did not wish a guest in her dwelling
to sit upon the bare hard ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last one time when the bear returned, his
nose was bright and black. His coat was glossy. He had grown fat upon the
badger's hospitality. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he entered the dwelling a pair of wicked
gleams shot out of his shaggy head. Surprised by the strange behavior of the
guest who remained standing upon the rug, leaning his round back against the
wall, father badger queried: &quot;How, my friend! What?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bear took one stride forward and shook his
paw in the badger's face. He said: &quot;I am strong, very strong!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, yes, so you are,&quot; replied the
badger. From the farther end of the room mother badger muttered over her bead work:
&quot;Yes, you grew strong from our well-filled bowls.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bear smiled, showing a row of large sharp
teeth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have no dwelling. I have no bags of
dried meat. I have no arrows. All these I have found here on this spot,&quot;
said he, stamping his heavy foot. &quot;I want them! See! I am strong!&quot;
repeated he, lifting both his terrible paws. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Quietly the father badger spoke: &quot;I fed
you. I called you friend, though you came here a stranger and a beggar. For the
sake of my little ones leave us in peace.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Mother badger, in her excited way, had pierced
hard through the buckskin and stuck her fingers repeatedly with her sharp awl
until she had laid aside her work. Now, while her husband was talking to the
bear, she motioned with her hands to the children. On tiptoe they hastened to
her side. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For reply came a low growl. It grew louder and
more fierce. &quot;Wa-ough!&quot; he roared, and by force hurled the badgers
out. First the father badger; then the mother. The little badgers he tossed by
pairs. He threw them hard upon the ground. Standing in the entrance way and
showing his ugly teeth, he snarled, &quot;Be gone!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The father and mother badger, having gained
their feet, picked up their kicking little babes, and, wailing aloud, drew the
air into their flattened lungs till they could stand alone upon their feet. No
sooner had the baby badgers caught their breath than they howled and shrieked
with pain and fright. Ah! what a dismal cry was theirs as the whole badger
family went forth wailing from out their own dwelling! A little distance away
from their stolen house the father badger built a small round hut. He made it
of bent willows and covered it with dry grass and twigs. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This was shelter for the night; but alas! it was
empty of food and arrows. All day father badger prowled through the forest, but
without his arrows he could not get food for his children. Upon his return, the
cry of the little ones for meat, the sad quiet of the mother with bowed head,
hurt him like a poisoned arrow wound. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I'll beg meat for you!&quot; said he in an
unsteady voice. Covering his head and entire body in a long loose robe he
halted beside the big black bear. The bear was slicing red meat to hang upon
the rack. He did not pause for a look at the comer. As the badger stood there
unrecognized, he saw that the bear had brought with him his whole family.
Little cubs played under the high-hanging new meats. They laughed and pointed
with their wee noses upward at the thin sliced meats upon the poles. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have you no heart, Black Bear? My children
are starving. Give me a small piece of meat for them,&quot; begged the badger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wa-ough!&quot; growled the angry bear, and
pounced upon the badger. &quot;Be gone!&quot; said he, and with his big hind
foot he sent father badger sprawling on the ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All the little ruffian bears hooted and shouted
&quot;ha-ha!&quot; to see the beggar fall upon his face. There was one,
however, who did not even smile. He was the youngest cub. His fur coat was not
as black and glossy as those his elders wore. The hair was dry and dingy. It
looked much more like kinky wool. He was the ugly cub. Poor little baby bear!
he had always been laughed at by his older brothers. He could not help being
himself. He could not change the differences between himself and his brothers.
Thus again, though the rest laughed aloud at the badger's fall, he did not see
the joke. His face was long and earnest. In his heart he was sad to see the
badgers crying and starving. In his breast spread a burning desire to share his
food with them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I shall not ask my father for meat to give
away. He would say 'No!' Then my brothers would laugh at me,&quot; said the
ugly baby bear to himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In an instant, as if his good intention had
passed from him, he was singing happily and skipping around his father at work.
Singing in his small high voice and dragging his feet in long strides after
him, as if a prankish spirit oozed out from his heels, he strayed off through
the tall grass. He was ambling toward the small round hut. When directly in
front of the entrance way, he made a quick side kick with his left hind leg.
Lo! there fell into the badger's hut a piece of fresh meat. It was tough meat,
full of sinews, yet it was the only piece he could take without his father's
notice. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus having given meat to the hungry badgers,
the ugly baby bear ran quickly away to his father again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the following day the father badger came back
once more. He stood watching the big bear cutting thin slices of meat. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Give—&quot; he began, when the bear
turning upon him with a growl, thrust him cruelly aside. The badger fell on his
hands. He fell where the grass was wet with the blood of the newly carved
buffalo. His keen starving eyes caught sight of a little red clot lying bright
upon the green. Looking fearfully toward the bear and seeing his head was
turned away, he snatched up the small thick blood. Underneath his girdled
blanket he hid it in his hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On his return to his family, he said within
himself: &quot;I'll pray the Great Spirit to bless it.&quot; Thus he built a
small round lodge. Sprinkling water upon the heated heap of sacred stones within,
he made ready to purge his body. &quot;The buffalo blood, too, must be purified
before I ask a blessing upon it,&quot; thought the badger. He carried it into
the sacred vapor lodge. After placing it near the sacred stones, he sat down
beside it. After a long silence, he muttered: &quot;Great Spirit, bless this
little buffalo blood.&quot; Then he arose, and with a quiet dignity stepped out
of the lodge. Close behind him some one followed. The badger turned to look
over his shoulder and to his great joy he beheld a Dakota brave in handsome
buckskins. In his hand he carried a magic arrow. Across his back dangled a long
fringed quiver. In answer to the badger's prayer, the avenger had sprung from
out the red globules. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son!&quot; exclaimed the badger with
extended right hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, father,&quot; replied the brave;
&quot;I am your avenger!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Immediately the badger told the sad story of his
hungry little ones and the stingy bear. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Listening closely the young man stood looking
steadily upon the ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length the father badger moved away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Where?&quot; queried the avenger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son, we have no food. I am going again
to beg for meat,&quot; answered the badger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then I go with you,&quot; replied the
young brave. This made the old badger happy. He was proud of his son. He was
delighted to be called &quot;father&quot; by the first human creature. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bear saw the badger coming in the distance.
He narrowed his eyes at the tall stranger walking beside him. He spied the
arrow. At once he guessed it was the avenger of whom he had heard long, long
ago. As they approached, the bear stood erect with a hand on his thigh. He
smiled upon them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, badger, my friend! Here is my knife.
Cut your favorite pieces from the deer,&quot; said he, holding out a long thin
blade. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How!&quot; said the badger eagerly. He
wondered what had inspired the big bear to such a generous deed. The young
avenger waited till the badger took the long knife in his hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Gazing full into the black bear's face, he said:
&quot;I come to do justice. You have returned only a knife to my poor father.
Now return to him his dwelling.&quot; His voice was deep and powerful. In his
black eyes burned a steady fire. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The long strong teeth of the bear rattled
against each other, and his shaggy body shook with fear. &quot;Ahow!&quot;
cried he, as if he had been shot. Running into the dwelling he gasped,
breathless and trembling, &quot;Come out, all of you! This is the badger's
dwelling. We must flee to the forest for fear of the avenger who carries the
magic arrow.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Out they hurried, all the bears, and disappeared
into the woods. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Singing and laughing, the badgers returned to
their own dwelling. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the avenger left them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I go,&quot; said he in parting, &quot;over
the earth.&quot; </span></p>
