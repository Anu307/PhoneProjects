style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe WP Semibold","sans-serif"'>The
Story of Pretty Goldilocks</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon
a time there was a princess who was the prettiest creature in the world. And
because she was so beautiful, and because her hair was like the finest gold,
and waved and rippled nearly to the ground, she was called Pretty Goldilocks.
She always wore a crown of flowers, and her dresses were embroidered with
diamonds and pearls, and everybody who saw her fell in love with her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now one of
her neighbors was a young king who was not married. He was very rich and
handsome, and when he heard all that was said about Pretty Goldilocks, though
he had never seen her, he fell so deeply in love with her that he could neither
eat nor drink. So he resolved to send an ambassador to ask her in marriage. He
had a splendid carriage made for his ambassador, and gave him more than a
hundred horses and a hundred servants, and told him to be sure and bring the
Princess back with him. After he had started nothing else was talked of at
Court, and the King felt so sure that the Princess would consent that he set
his people to work at pretty dresses and splendid furniture, that they might be
ready by the time she came. Meanwhile, the ambassador arrived at the Princess's
palace and delivered his little message, but whether she happened to be cross
that day, or whether the compliment did not please her, is not known. She only
answered that she was very much obliged to the King, but she had no wish to be
married. The ambassador set off sadly on his homeward way, bringing all the
King's presents back with him, for the Princess was too well brought up to
accept the pearls and diamonds when she would not accept the King, so she had
only kept twenty- five English pins that he might not be vexed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the
ambassador reached the city, where the King was waiting impatiently, everybody
was very much annoyed with him for not bringing the Princess, and the King
cried like a baby, and nobody could console him. Now there was at the Court a
young man, who was more clever and handsome than anyone else. He was called
Charming, and everyone loved him, excepting a few envious people who were angry
at his being the King's favorite and knowing all the State secrets. He happened
to one day be with some people who were speaking of the ambassador's return and
saying that his going to the Princess had not done much good, when Charming
said rashly:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If
the King had sent me to the Princess Goldilocks I am sure she would have come
back with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His
enemies at once went to the King and said:</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You
will hardly believe, sire, what Charming has the audacity to say--that if HE
had been sent to the Princess Goldilocks she would certainly have come back
with him. He seems to think that he is so much handsomer than you that the
Princess would have fallen in love with him and followed him willingly.&quot;
The King was very angry when he heard this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ha,
ha!&quot; said he; &quot;does he laugh at my unhappiness, and think himself
more fascinating than I am? Go, and let him be shut up in my great tower to die
of hunger.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the
King's guards went to fetch Charming, who had thought no more of his rash
speech, and carried him off to prison with great cruelty. The poor prisoner had
only a little straw for his bed, and but for a little stream of water which
flowed through the tower he would have died of thirst.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

when he was in despair he said to himself:</span></p>

8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How
can I have offended the King? I am his most faithful subject, and have done
nothing against him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King
chanced to be passing the tower and recognized the voice of his former
favorite. He stopped to listen in spite of Charming's enemies, who tried to
persuade him to have nothing more to do with the traitor. But the King said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

quiet, I wish to hear what he says.&quot;</span></p>

8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And then
he opened the tower door and called to Charming, who came very sadly and kissed
the King's hand, saying:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

have I done, sire, to deserve this cruel treatment?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You
mocked me and my ambassador,&quot; said the King, &quot;and you said that if I
had sent you for the Princess Goldilocks you would certainly have brought her
back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It
is quite true, sire,&quot; replied Charming; &quot;I should have drawn such a
picture of you, and represented your good qualities in such a way, that I am
certain the Princess would have found you irresistible. But I cannot see what
there is in that to make you angry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King
could not see any cause for anger either when the matter was presented to him
in this light, and he be- gan to frown very fiercely at the courtiers who had
so misrepresented his favorite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he took
Charming back to the palace with him, and after seeing that he had a very good supper
he said to him:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

know that I love Pretty Goldilocks as much as ever, her refusal has not made
any difference to me; but I don't know how to make her change her mind; I
really should like to send you, to see if you can persuade her to marry
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Charming
replied that he was perfectly willing to go, and would set out the very next
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But
you must wait till I can get a grand escort for you,&quot; said the King. But
Charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride, and the King, who was
delighted at his being ready to start so promptly, gave him letters to the
Princess, and bade him good speed. It was on a Monday morning that he set out
all alone upon his errand, thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the
Princess Goldilocks to marry the King. He had a writing-book in his pocket, and
whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down
under the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the
Princess, before he forgot it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day
when he had started at the very earliest dawn, and was riding over a great
meadow, he suddenly had a capital idea, and, springing from his horse, he sat
down under a willow tree which grew by a little river. When he had written it
down he was looking round him, pleased to find himself in such a pretty place,
when all at once he saw a great golden carp lying gasping and exhausted upon
the grass. In leaping after little flies she had thrown herself high upon the
bank, where she had lain till she was nearly dead. Charming had pity upon her,
and, though he couldn't help thinking that she would have been very nice for
dinner, he picked her up gently and put her back into the water. As soon as
Dame Carp felt the refreshing coolness of the water she sank down joyfully to
the bottom of the river, then, swimming up to the bank quite boldly, she said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I
thank you, Charming, for the kindness you have done me. You have saved my life;
one day I will repay you.&quot; So saying, she sank down into the water again,
leaving Charming greatly astonished at her politeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Another
day, as he journeyed on, he saw a raven in great distress. The poor bird was
closely pursued by an eagle, which would soon have eaten it up, had not
Charming quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the eagle dead. The raven
perched upon a tree very joyfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

said he, &quot;it was very generous of you to rescue a poor raven; I am not
ungrateful, some day I will repay you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

thought it was very nice of the raven to say so, and went on his way.</span></p>

sun rose he found himself in a thick wood where it was too dark for him to see
his path, and here he heard an owl crying as if it were in despair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

said he, &quot;that must be an owl in great trouble, I am sure it has gone into
a snare&quot;; and he began to hunt about, and presently found a great net
which some bird- catchers had spread the night before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What
a pity it is that men do nothing but torment and persecute poor creatures which
never do them any harm!&quot; said he, and he took out his knife and cut the cords
of the net, and the owl flitted away into the darkness, but then turning, with
one flicker of her wings, she came back to Charming and said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

does not need many words to tell you how great a service you have done me. I
was caught; in a few minutes the fowlers would have been here--without your
help I should have been killed. I am grateful, and one day I will repay
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

three adventures were the only ones of any consequence that befell Charming
upon his journey, and he made all the haste he could to reach the palace of the
Princess Goldilocks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

arrived he thought everything he saw delightful and magnificent. Diamonds were
as plentiful as pebbles, and the gold and silver, the beautiful dresses, the
sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere quite amazed him; he thought
to himself: &quot;If the Princess consents to leave all this, and come with me
to marry the King, he may think himself lucky!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

dressed himself carefully in rich brocade, with scarlet and white plumes, and
threw a splendid embroidered scarf over his shoulder, and, looking as gay and
as graceful as possible, he presented himself at the door of the palace,
carrying in his arm a tiny pretty dog which he had bought on the way. The
guards saluted him respectfully, and a messenger was sent to the Princess to
announce the arrival of Charming as ambassador of her neighbor the King.</span></p>

he does, madam,&quot; said all her maids of honor in one breath. &quot;We saw
him from the window of the garret where we were spinning flax, and we could do
nothing but look at him as long as he was in sight.&quot;</span></p>

to be sure,&quot; said the Princess, &quot;that's how you amuse yourselves, is
it? Looking at strangers out of the window! Be quick and give me my blue satin
embroidered dress, and comb out my golden hair. Let somebody make me fresh
garlands of flowers, and give me my high- heeled shoes and my fan, and tell
them to sweep my great hall and my throne, for I want everyone to say I am
really `Pretty Goldilocks.'&quot;</span></p>

imagine how all her maids scurried this way and that to make the Princess
ready, and how in their haste they knocked their heads together and hindered
each other, till she thought they would never have done. However, at last they
led her into the gallery of mirrors that she might assure herself that nothing
was lacking in her appearance, and then she mounted her throne of gold, ebony, and
ivory, while her ladies took their guitars and began to sing softly. Then
Charming was led in, and was so struck with astonishment and admiration that at
first not a word could he say. But presently he took courage and delivered his
harangue, bravely ending by begging the Princess to spare him the
disappointment of going back without her.</span></p>

Charming,&quot; answered she, &quot;all the reasons you have given me are very
good ones, and I assure you that I should have more pleasure in obliging you
than anyone else, but you must know that a month ago as I was walking by the
river with my ladies I took off my glove, and as I did so a ring that I was
wearing slipped off my finger and rolled into the water. As I valued it more
than my kingdom, you may imagine how vexed I was at losing it, and I vowed to
never listen to any proposal of marriage unless the ambassador first brought me
back my ring. So now you know what is expected of you, for if you talked for
fifteen days and fifteen nights you could not make me change my mind.&quot;</span></p>

was very much surprised by this answer, but he bowed low to the Princess, and
begged her to accept the embroidered scarf and the tiny dog he had brought with
him. But she answered that she did not want any presents, and that he was to
remember what she had just told him. When he got back to his lodging he went to
bed without eating any supper, and his little dog, who was called Frisk,
couldn't eat any either, but came and lay down close to him. All night Charming
sighed and lamented.</span></p>

knowing it was impossible.&quot; And then he sighed again.</span></p>

uttered the most terrible threats against me, and vowed that he would lay waste
my country. But what could I do? I could not marry a frightful giant as tall as
a tower, who eats up people as a monkey eats chestnuts, and who talks so loud

not cease to persecute me and to kill my subjects. So before I can listen to

giant Galifron was, and that nobody dared go near him; and the more he heard,
the more frightened he grew. Frisk tried to encourage him by saying:

Charming standing, sword in hand this put the giant into a terrible rage, and
he aimed a blow at Charming with his huge iron club, which would certainly have
killed him if it had reached him, but at that instant a raven perched upon the
giant's head, and, pecking with its strong beak and beating with its great
wings so confused and blinded him that all his blows fell harmlessly upon the

dragons with fiery eyes, who will not allow anyone to pass them. When you get
into the cavern you will find an immense hole, which you must go down, and it
is full of toads and snakes; at the bottom of this hole there is another little
cave, in which rises the Fountain of Health and Beauty. It is some of this
water that I really must have: everything it touches becomes wonderful. The
beautiful things will always remain beautiful, and the ugly things become
lovely. If one is young one never grows old, and if one is old one becomes

to let his horse graze, while Frisk amused himself by chasing flies. Charming
knew he could not be far from the Gloomy Cavern, and on looking about him he
saw a black hideous rock from which came a thick smoke, followed in a moment by
one of the dragons with fire blazing from his mouth and eyes. His body was
yellow and green, and his claws scarlet, and his tail was so long that it lay
in a hundred coils. Frisk was so terrified at the sight of it that he did not
know where to hide. Charming, quite determined to get the water or die, now
drew his sword, and, taking the crystal flask which Pretty Goldilocks had given
him to fill, said to Frisk:</span></p>

time returned with the flask, filled to the very brim with sparkling water.

face with the water from the Fountain of Beauty, which was in the flask on a
shelf in the Princess's room, where she had placed it that she might see it

had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it, and every drop of the water
had been spilt. Not knowing what to do, she had hastily swept away the pieces
