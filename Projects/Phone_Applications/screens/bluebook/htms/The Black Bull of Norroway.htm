Norroway, langsyne, there lived a certain lady, and she had three dochters. The

and the dochter gaed awa' to an auld witch washerwife and telled her purpose.
The auld wife bade her stay that day, and gang and look out o' her back door,
and see what she could see. She saw nocht the first day. The second day she did
the same, and saw nocht. On the third day she looked again, and saw a
coach-and-six coming along the road. She ran in and telled the auld wife what

wonderfully refreshed. And lang they gaed, and sair they rade, till they came
in sight o' a very big and bonny castle. &quot;Yonder we maun be this
night,&quot; quo' the bull; &quot;for my auld brither lives yonder&quot;; and
presently they were at the place. They lifted her aff his back, and took her
in, and sent him away to a park for the night. In the morning, when they
brought the bull hame, they took the lady into a fine shining parlor, and gave
her a beautiful apple, telling her no to break it till she was in the greatest
strait ever mortal was in in the world, and that wad bring her o't. Again she
was lifted on the bull's back, and after she had ridden far, and farer than I
can tell, they came in sight o' a far bonnier castle, and far farther awa' than
the last. Says the bull till her: &quot;Yonder we maun be the night, for my
second brither lives yonder&quot;; and they were at the place directly. They
lifted her down and took her in, and sent the bull to the field for the night.
In the morning they took the lady into a fine and rich room, and gave her the
finest pear she had ever seen, bidding her no to break it till she was in the
greatest strait ever mortal could be in, and that wad get her out o't. Again
she was lifted and set on his back, and awa' they went. And lang they gaed, and
sair they rade, till they came in sight o' the far biggest castle, and far
farthest aff, they had yet seen. &quot;We maun be yonder the night,&quot; says
the bull, &quot;for my young brither lives yonder&quot;; and they were there
directly. They lifted her down, took her in, and sent the bull to the field for
the night. In the morning they took her into a room, the finest of a', and gied
her a plum, telling her no to break it till she was in the greatest strait
mortal could be in, and that wad get her out o't. Presently they brought hame
the bull, set the lady on his back, and awa' they went.</span></p>

they gaed, and on they rade, till they came to a dark and ugsome glen, where
they stopped, and the lady lighted down. Says the bull to her: &quot;Here ye
maun stay till I gang and fight the deil. Ye maun seat yoursel' on that stane,
and move neither hand nor fit till I come back, else I'll never find ye again.
And if everything round about ye turns blue I hae beated the deil; but should

stane, and by-and-by a' round her turned blue. O'ercome wi' joy, she lifted the
ae fit and crossed it owre the ither, sae glad was she that her companion was
victorious. The bull returned and sought for but never could find her.</span></p>

sat, and aye she grat, till she wearied. At last she rase and gaed awa', she
kedna whaur till. On she wandered till she came to a great hill o' glass, that
she tried a' she could to climb, bat wasna able. Round the bottom o' the hill
she gaed, sabbing and seeking a passage owre, till at last she came to a
smith's house; and the smith promised, if she wad serve him seven years, he wad
make her iron shoon, wherewi' she could climb owre the glassy hill. At seven
years' end she got her iron shoon, clamb the glassy hill, and chanced to come
to the auld washerwife's habitation. There she was telled of a gallant young
knight that had given in some bluidy sarks to wash, and whaever washed thae
sarks was to be his wife. The auld wife had washed till she was tired, and then
she set to her dochter, and baith washed, and they washed, and they better
washed, in hopes of getting the young knight; but a' they could do they couldna
bring out a stain. At length they set the stranger damosel to wark; and whenever
she began the stains came out pure and clean, but the auld wife made the knight
believe it was her dochter had washed the sarks. So the knight and the eldest
dochter were to be married, and the stranger damosel was distracted at the
thought of it, for she was deeply in love wi' him. So she bethought her of her
apple, and breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious jewelry, the
richest she had ever seen. &quot;All these,&quot; she said to the eldest
dochter, &quot;I will give you, on condition that you put off your marriage for
ae day, and allow me to go into his room alone at night.&quot; So the lady
consented; but meanwhile the auld wife had prepared a sleeping-drink, and given
it to the knight, wha drank it, and never wakened till next morning. The
lee-lang night ther damosel sabbed and sang:</span></p>

she kentna what to do for grief. She then brak the pear, and found it filled
wi' jewelry far richer than the contents o' the apple. Wi' thae jewels she
bargained for permission to be a second night in the young knight's chamber;
but the auld wife gied him anither sleeping-drink, and he again sleepit till
morning. A' night she kept sighing and singing as before:</span></p>

lost hope a'thegither. But that day when he was out at the hunting, somebody
asked him what noise and moaning was yon they heard all last night in his
bedchamber. He said he heardna ony noise. But they assured him there was sae;
and he resolved to keep waking that night to try what he could hear. That being
the third night, and the damosel being between hope and despair, she brak her
plum, and it held far the richest jewelry of the three. She bargained as
before; and the auld wife, as before, took in the sleeping-drink to the young
knight's chamber; but he telled her he couldna drink it that night without
sweetening. And when she gaed awa' for some honey to sweeten it wi', he poured
out the drink, and sae made the auld wife think he had drunk it. They a' went
to bed again, and the damosel began, as before, singing:</span></p>
