<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe WP Semibold","sans-serif"'>The
Master Cat; or, Puss in Boots</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was a miller who left no more estate to
the three sons he had than his mill, his ass, and his cat. The partition was
soon made. Neither scrivener nor attorney was sent for. They would soon have
eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the mill, the second the ass,
and the youngest nothing but the cat. The poor young fellow was quite
comfortless at having so poor a lot.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brothers,&quot; said he, &quot;may get
their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together; but for my
part, when I have eaten up my cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die
of hunger.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he
did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do not thus afflict yourself, my good
master. You have nothing else to do but to give me a bag and get a pair of
boots made for me that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you
shall see that you have not so bad a portion in me as you imagine.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Cat's master did not build very much upon
what he said. He had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch
rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the
meal, and make as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his
affording him some help in his miserable condition. When the Cat had what he
asked for he booted himself very gallantly, and putting his bag about his neck,
he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went into a warren where was
great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and
stretching out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young
rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage
his bag for what he had put into it.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarce was he lain down but he had what he
wanted. A rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss,
immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud
of his prey, he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty.
He was shown upstairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence,
said to him:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the
warren, which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas&quot; (for that was the
title which puss was pleased to give his master) &quot;has commanded me to
present to your majesty from him.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell thy master,&quot; said the king,
&quot;that I thank him and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Another time he went and hid himself among some
standing corn, holding still his bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran
into it he drew the strings and so caught them both. He went and made a present
of these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the
warren. The king, in like manner, received the partridges with great pleasure,
and ordered him some money for drink.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Cat continued for two or three months thus
to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day
in particular, when he knew for certain that he was to take the air along the
river-side, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world, he
said to his master:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you will follow my advice your fortune
is made. You have nothing else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in
that part I shall show you, and leave the rest to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised
him to, without knowing why or wherefore. While he was washing the King passed
by, and the Cat began to cry out:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Help! help! My Lord Marquis of Carabas is
going to be drowned.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this noise the King put his head out of the
coach- window, and, finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such
good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his
Lordship the Marquis of Carabas. While they were drawing the poor Marquis out
of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the King that, while his
master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes,
though he had cried out: &quot;Thieves! thieves!&quot; several times, as loud
as he could.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great
stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and
fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King caressed him after a very extraordinary
manner, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good
mien (for he was well made and very handsome in his person), the King's
daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no
sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in
love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into the coach
and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin
to succeed, marched on before, and, meeting with some countrymen, who were
mowing a meadow, he said to them:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good people, you who are mowing, if you do
not tell the King that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of
Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King did not fail asking of the mowers to
whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,&quot;
answered they altogether, for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid .</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You see, sir,&quot; said the Marquis,
&quot;this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every
year.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Master Cat, who went still on before, met
with some reapers, and said to them:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good people, you who are reaping, if you
do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you
shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King, who passed by a moment after, would
needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,&quot; replied
the reapers, and the King was very well pleased with it, as well as the
Marquis, whom he congratulated thereupon. The Master Cat, who went always
before, said the same words to all he met, and the King was astonished at the
vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle,
the master of which was an ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the
lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who
had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked
to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having
the honor of paying his respects to him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre
could do, and made him sit down.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have been assured,&quot; said the Cat,
&quot;that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of
creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a
lion, or elephant, and the like.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is true,&quot; answered the ogre very
briskly; &quot;and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a
lion so near him that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance
of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were of no use at all to him
in walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre
had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much
frightened.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have been, moreover, informed,&quot;
said the Cat, &quot;but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the
power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change
yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you I take this to be
impossible.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Impossible!&quot; cried the ogre;
&quot;you shall see that presently. &quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And at the same time he changed himself into a
mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no sooner perceived this but he
fell upon him and ate him up.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this
fine castle of the ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise
of his Majesty's coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the
King:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of
my Lord Marquis of Carabas.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What! my Lord Marquis,&quot; cried the
King, &quot;and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer
than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into
it, if you please.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and
followed the King, who went first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they
found a magnificent collation, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who
were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing the King was
there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my Lord
Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who had fallen violently in love with
him, and, seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drunk
five or six glasses:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord
Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Marquis, making several low bows, accepted
the honor which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same
day, married the Princess.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Puss became a great lord, and never ran after
mice any more but only for his diversion.</span></p>
