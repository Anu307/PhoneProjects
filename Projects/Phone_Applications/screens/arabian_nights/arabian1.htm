<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Arabian Nights</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the chronicles of the
ancient dynasty of the Sassanidae, who reigned for about four hundred years,
from Persia to the borders of China, beyond the great river Ganges itself, we
read the praises of one of the kings of this race, who was said to be the best
monarch of his time. His subjects loved him, and his neighbors feared him, and
when he died he left his kingdom in a more prosperous and powerful condition
than any king had done before him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two sons who
survived him loved each other tenderly, and it was a real grief to the elder,
Schahriar, that the laws of the empire forbade him to share his dominions with
his brother Schahzeman. Indeed, after ten years, during which this state of
things had not ceased to trouble him, Schahriar cut off the country of Great
Tartary from the Persian Empire and made his brother king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the Sultan Schahriar
had a wife whom he loved more than all the world, and his greatest happiness
was to surround her with splendour, and to give her the finest dresses and the
most beautiful jewels. It was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that
he accidentally discovered, after several years, that she had deceived him
completely, and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad, that he felt
himself obliged to carry out the law of the land, and order the grand-vizir to
put her to death. The blow was so heavy that his mind almost gave way, and he
declared that he was quite sure that at bottom all women were as wicked as the
sultana, if you could only find them out, and that the fewer the world
contained the better. So every evening he married a fresh wife and had her
strangled the following morning before the grand-vizir, whose duty it was to
provide these unhappy brides for the Sultan. The poor man fulfilled his task
with reluctance, but there was no escape, and every day saw a girl married and
a wife dead. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This behaviour caused
the greatest horror in the town, where nothing was heard but cries and
lamentations. In one house was a father weeping for the loss of his daughter,
in another perhaps a mother trembling for the fate of her child; and instead of
the blessings that had formerly been heaped on the Sultan's head, the air was
now full of curses. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir himself
was the father of two daughters, of whom the elder was called Scheherazade, and
the younger Dinarzade. Dinarzade had no particular gifts to distinguish her
from other girls, but her sister was clever and courageous in the highest
degree. Her father had given her the best masters in philosophy, medicine,
history and the fine arts, and besides all this, her beauty excelled that of
any girl in the kingdom of Persia. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day, when the
grand-vizir was talking to his eldest daughter, who was his delight and pride,
Scheherazade said to him, &quot;Father, I have a favour to ask of you. Will you
grant it to me?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I can refuse you
nothing,&quot; replied he, &quot;that is just and reasonable.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then listen,&quot;
said Scheherazade. &quot;I am determined to stop this barbarous practice of the
Sultan's, and to deliver the girls and mothers from the awful fate that hangs
over them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It would be an
excellent thing to do,&quot; returned the grand-vizir, &quot;but how do you
propose to accomplish it?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My father,&quot;
answered Scheherazade, &quot;it is you who have to provide the Sultan daily
with a fresh wife, and I implore you, by all the affection you bear me, to
allow the honour to fall upon me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have you lost your
senses?&quot; cried the grand-vizir, starting back in horror. &quot;What has
put such a thing into your head? You ought to know by this time what it means
to be the sultan's bride!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my father, I
know it well,&quot; replied she, &quot;and I am not afraid to think of it. If I
fail, my death will be a glorious one, and if I succeed I shall have done a
great service to my country.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is of no
use,&quot; said the grand-vizir, &quot;I shall never consent. If the Sultan was
to order me to plunge a dagger in your heart, I should have to obey. What a
task for a father! Ah, if you do not fear death, fear at any rate the anguish
you would cause me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Once again, my
father,&quot; said Scheherazade, &quot;will you grant me what I ask?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What, are you
still so obstinate?&quot; exclaimed the grand-vizir. &quot;Why are you so
resolved upon your own ruin?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the maiden
absolutely refused to attend to her father's words, and at length, in despair,
the grand-vizir was obliged to give way, and went sadly to the palace to tell
the Sultan that the following evening he would bring him Scheherazade. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan received this
news with the greatest astonishment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How have you made
up your mind,&quot; he asked, &quot;to sacrifice your own daughter to me?&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
answered the grand-vizir, &quot;it is her own wish. Even the sad fate that
awaits her could not hold her back.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let there be no
mistake, vizir,&quot; said the Sultan. &quot;Remember you will have to take her
life yourself. If you refuse, I swear that your head shall pay forfeit.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
returned the vizir. &quot;Whatever the cost, I will obey you. Though a father,
I am also your subject.&quot; So the Sultan told the grand-vizir he might bring
his daughter as soon as he liked. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir took back this
news to Scheherazade, who received it as if it had been the most pleasant thing
in the world. She thanked her father warmly for yielding to her wishes, and,
seeing him still bowed down with grief, told him that she hoped he would never
repent having allowed her to marry the Sultan. Then she went to prepare herself
for the marriage, and begged that her sister Dinarzade should be sent for to
speak to her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they were alone,
Scheherazade addressed her thus: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My dear sister; I
want your help in a very important affair. My father is going to take me to the
palace to celebrate my marriage with the Sultan. When his Highness receives me,
I shall beg him, as a last favour, to let you sleep in our chamber, so that I
may have your company during the last night I am alive. If, as I hope, he
grants me my wish, be sure that you wake me an hour before the dawn, and speak
to me in these words: 'My sister, if you are not asleep, I beg you, before the
sun rises, to tell me one of your charming stories.' Then I shall begin, and I
hope by this means to deliver the people from the terror that reigns over
them.&quot; Dinarzade replied that she would do with pleasure what her sister
wished. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the usual hour
arrived the grand-vizir conducted Scheherazade to the palace, and left her
alone with the Sultan, who bade her raise her veil and was amazed at her
beauty. But seeing her eyes full of tears, he asked what was the matter.
&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Scheherazade, &quot;I have a sister who loves me as
tenderly as I love her. Grant me the favour of allowing her to sleep this night
in the same room, as it is the last we shall be together.&quot; Schahriar
consented to Scheherazade's petition and Dinarzade was sent for. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>An hour before daybreak
Dinarzade awoke, and exclaimed, as she had promised, &quot;My dear sister, if
you are not asleep, tell me I pray you, before the sun rises, one of your
charming stories. It is the last time that I shall have the pleasure of hearing
you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scheherazade did not
answer her sister, but turned to the Sultan. &quot;Will your highness permit me
to do as my sister asks?&quot; said she. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Willingly,&quot;
he answered. So Scheherazade began. </span></p>

Genius</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sire, there was once
upon a time a merchant who possessed great wealth, in land and merchandise, as
well as in ready money. He was obliged from time to time to take journeys to
arrange his affairs. One day, having to go a long way from home, he mounted his
horse, taking with him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits and
dates, because he had to pass through the desert where no food was to be got.
He arrived without any mishap, and, having finished his business, set out on
his return. On the fourth day of his journey, the heat of the sun being very
great, he turned out of his road to rest under some trees. He found at the foot
of a large walnut-tree a fountain of clear and running water. He dismounted,
fastened his horse to a branch of the tree, and sat by the fountain, after
having taken from his wallet some of his dates and biscuits. When he had
finished this frugal meal he washed his face and hands in the fountain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he was thus
employed he saw an enormous genius, white with rage, coming towards him, with a
scimitar in his hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Arise,&quot; he
cried in a terrible voice, &quot;and let me kill you as you have killed my
son!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he uttered these
words he gave a frightful yell. The merchant, quite as much terrified at the
hideous face of the monster as at his words, answered him tremblingly,
&quot;Alas, good sir, what can I have done to you to deserve death?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I shall kill
you,&quot; repeated the genius, &quot;as you have killed my son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; said
the merchant, &quot;how can I have killed your son? I do not know him, and I
have never even seen him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When you arrived
here did you not sit down on the ground?&quot; asked the genius, &quot;and did
you not take some dates from your wallet, and whilst eating them did not you
throw the stones about?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said
the merchant, &quot;I certainly did so.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then,&quot; said
the genius, &quot;I tell you you have killed my son, for whilst you were
throwing about the stones, my son passed by, and one of them struck him in the
eye and killed him. So I shall kill you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah, sir, forgive
me!&quot; cried the merchant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will have no
mercy on you,&quot; answered the genius. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But I killed your
son quite unintentionally, so I implore you to spare my life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No,&quot; said the
genius, &quot;I shall kill you as you killed my son,&quot; and so saying, he
seized the merchant by the arm, threw him on the ground, and lifted his sabre
to cut off his head. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, protesting
his innocence, bewailed his wife and children, and tried pitifully to avert his
fate. The genius, with his raised scimitar, waited till he had finished, but
was not in the least touched. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scheherazade, at this
point, seeing that it was day, and knowing that the Sultan always rose very
early to attend the council, stopped speaking. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Indeed,
sister,&quot; said Dinarzade, &quot;this is a wonderful story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The rest is still
more wonderful,&quot; replied Scheherazade, &quot;and you would say so, if the
sultan would allow me to live another day, and would give me leave to tell it
to you the next night.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Schahriar, who had been
listening to Scheherazade with pleasure, said to himself, &quot;I will wait
till to-morrow; I can always have her killed when I have heard the end of her
story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All this time the
grand-vizir was in a terrible state of anxiety. But he was much delighted when
he saw the Sultan enter the council-chamber without giving the terrible command
that he was expecting. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning, before
the day broke, Dinarzade said to her sister, &quot;Dear sister, if you are
awake I pray you to go on with your story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan did not wait
for Scheherazade to ask his leave. &quot;Finish,&quot; said he, &quot;the story
of the genius and the merchant. I am curious to hear the end.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So Scheherazade went on
with the story. This happened every morning. The Sultana told a story, and the
Sultan let her live to finish it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the merchant saw
that the genius was determined to cut off his head, he said: &quot;One word
more, I entreat you. Grant me a little delay; just a short time to go home and
bid my wife and children farewell, and to make my will. When I have done this I
will come back here, and you shall kill me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; said
the genius, &quot;if I grant you the delay you ask, I am afraid that you will
not come back.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I give you my word
of honour,&quot; answered the merchant, &quot;that I will come back without
fail.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How long do you
require?&quot; asked the genius. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I ask you for a
year's grace,&quot; replied the merchant. &quot;I promise you that to-morrow
twelvemonth, I shall be waiting under these trees to give myself up to
you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On this the genius left
him near the fountain and disappeared. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, having
recovered from his fright, mounted his horse and went on his road. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he arrived home his
wife and children received him with the greatest joy. But instead of embracing
them he began to weep so bitterly that they soon guessed that something
terrible was the matter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell us, I pray
you,&quot; said his wife, &quot;what has happened.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot;
answered her husband, &quot;I have only a year to live.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he told them what
had passed between him and the genius, and how he had given his word to return
at the end of a year to be killed. When they heard this sad news they were in
despair, and wept much. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day the
merchant began to settle his affairs, and first of all to pay his debts. He
gave presents to his friends, and large alms to the poor. He set his slaves at
liberty, and provided for his wife and children. The year soon passed away, and
he was obliged to depart. When he tried to say good-bye he was quite overcome
with grief, and with difficulty tore himself away. At length he reached the
place where he had first seen the genius, on the very day that he had
appointed. He dismounted, and sat down at the edge of the fountain, where he
awaited the genius in terrible suspense. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst he was thus
waiting an old man leading a hind came towards him. They greeted one another,
and then the old man said to him, &quot;May I ask, brother, what brought you to
this desert place, where there are so many evil genii about? To see these
beautiful trees one would imagine it was inhabited, but it is a dangerous place
to stop long in.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant told the
old man why he was obliged to come there. He listened in astonishment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is a most
marvellous affair. I should like to be a witness of your interview with the
genius.&quot; So saying he sat down by the merchant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While they were talking
another old man came up, followed by two black dogs. He greeted them, and asked
what they were doing in this place. The old man who was leading the hind told
him the adventure of the merchant and the genius. The second old man had not
sooner heard the story than he, too, decided to stay there to see what would
happen. He sat down by the others, and was talking, when a third old man
arrived. He asked why the merchant who was with them looked so sad. They told
him the story, and he also resolved to see what would pass between the genius
and the merchant, so waited with the rest. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They soon saw in the
distance a thick smoke, like a cloud of dust. This smoke came nearer and
nearer, and then, all at once, it vanished, and they saw the genius, who,
without speaking to them, approached the merchant, sword in hand, and, taking
him by the arm, said, &quot;Get up and let me kill you as you killed my
son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant and the

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the old man leading
the hind threw himself at the monster's feet and said, &quot;O Prince of the
Genii, I beg of you to stay your fury and to listen to me. I am going to tell
you my story and that of the hind I have with me, and if you find it more
marvellous than that of the merchant whom you are about to kill, I hope that
you will do away with a third part of his punishment?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

my story (said the old man), so please attend. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This hind that you see
with me is my wife. We have no children of our own, therefore I adopted the son
of a favorite slave, and determined to make him my heir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My wife, however, took a
great dislike to both mother and child, which she concealed from me till too
late. When my adopted son was about ten years old I was obliged to go on a
journey. Before I went I entrusted to my wife's keeping both the mother and
child, and begged her to take care of them during my absence, which lasted a
whole year. During this time she studied magic in order to carry out her wicked
scheme. When she had learnt enough she took my son into a distant place and
changed him into a calf. Then she gave him to my steward, and told him to look
after a calf she had bought. She also changed the slave into a cow, which she
sent to my steward. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I returned I
inquired after my slave and the child. &quot;Your slave is dead,&quot; she
said, &quot;and as for your son, I have not seen him for two months, and I do
not know where he is.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was grieved to hear of
my slave's death, but as my son had only disappeared, I thought I should soon
find him. Eight months, however, passed, and still no tidings of him; then the
feast of Bairam came. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To celebrate it I
ordered my steward to bring me a very fat cow to sacrifice. He did so. The cow
that he brought was my unfortunate slave. I bound her, but just as I was about
to kill her she began to low most piteously, and I saw that her eyes were
streaming with tears. It seemed to me most extraordinary, and, feeling a
movement of pity, I ordered the steward to lead her away and bring another. My
wife, who was present, scoffed at my compassion, which made her malice of no
avail. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she cried. &quot;Kill this cow. It is
the best we have to sacrifice.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To please her, I tried
again, but again the animal's lows and tears disarmed me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take her
away,&quot; I said to the steward, &quot;and kill her; I cannot.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The steward killed her,
but on skinning her found that she was nothing but bones, although she appeared
so fat. I was vexed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Keep her for
yourself,&quot; I said to the steward, &quot;and if you have a fat calf, bring
that in her stead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In a short time he
brought a very fat calf, which, although I did not know it, was my son. It
tried hard to break its cord and come to me. It threw itself at my feet, with
its head on the ground, as if it wished to excite my pity, and to beg me not to
take away its life. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was even more
surprised and touched at this action than I had been at the tears of the cow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go,&quot; I said
to the steward, &quot;take back this calf, take great care of it, and bring me
another in its place instantly.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as my wife heard
me speak this she at once cried out, &quot;What are you doing, husband? Do not
sacrifice any calf but this.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wife,&quot; I
answered, &quot;I will not sacrifice this calf,&quot; and in spite of all her
remonstrances, I remained firm. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had another calf
killed; this one was led away. The next day the steward asked to speak to me in
private. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have come,&quot;
he said, &quot;to tell you some news which I think you will like to hear. I
have a daughter who knows magic. Yesterday, when I was leading back the calf
which you refused to sacrifice, I noticed that she smiled, and then directly
afterwards began to cry. I asked her why she did so.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Father,&quot; she
answered, &quot;this calf is the son of our master. I smile with joy at seeing
him still alive, and I weep to think of his mother, who was sacrificed
yesterday as a cow. These changes have been wrought by our master's wife, who
hated the mother and son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;At these words, of
Genius,&quot; continued the old man, &quot;I leave you to imagine my
astonishment. I went immediately with the steward to speak with his daughter
myself. First of all I went to the stable to see my son, and he replied in his
dumb way to all my caresses. When the steward's daughter came I asked her if
she could change my son back to his proper shape.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, I can,&quot;
she replied, &quot;on two conditions. One is that you will give him to me for a
husband, and the other is that you will let me punish the woman who changed him
into a calf.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To the first
condition,&quot; I answered, &quot;I agree with all my heart, and I will give
you an ample dowry. To the second I also agree, I only beg you to spare her
life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That I will
do,&quot; she replied; &quot;I will treat her as she treated your son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then she took a vessel
of water and pronounced over it some words I did not understand; then, on
throwing the water over him, he became immediately a young man once more. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son, my dear
son,&quot; I exclaimed, kissing him in a transport of joy. &quot;This kind
maiden has rescued you from a terrible enchantment, and I am sure that out of
gratitude you will marry her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He consented joyfully,
but before they were married, the young girl changed my wife into a hind, and
it is she whom you see before you. I wished her to have this form rather than a
stranger one, so that we could see her in the family without repugnance. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Since then my son has
become a widower and has gone travelling. I am now going in search of him, and
not wishing to confide my wife to the care of other people, I am taking her
with me. Is this not a most marvellous tale? </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is
indeed,&quot; said the genius, &quot;and because of it I grant to you the third
part of the punishment of this merchant.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the first old man
had finished his story, the second, who was leading the two black dogs, said to
the genius, &quot;I am going to tell you what happened to me, and I am sure
that you will find my story even more astonishing than the one to which you
have just been listening. But when I have related it, will you grant me also
the third part of the merchant's punishment?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Great prince of the
genii, you must know that we are three brothers--these two black dogs and
myself. Our father died, leaving us each a thousand sequins. With this sum we
all three took up the same profession, and became merchants. A short time after
we had opened our shops, my eldest brother, one of these two dogs, resolved to
travel in foreign countries for the sake of merchandise. With this intention he
sold all he had and bought merchandise suitable to the voyages he was about to
make. He set out, and was away a whole year. At the end of this time a beggar
came to my shop. &quot;Good-day,&quot; I said. &quot;Good-day,&quot; he
answered; &quot;is it possible that you do not recognise me?&quot; Then I
looked at him closely and saw he was my brother. I made him come into my house,
and asked him how he had fared in his enterprise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do not question
me,&quot; he replied, &quot;see me, you see all I have. It would but renew my
trouble to tell of all the misfortunes that have befallen me in a year, and
have brought me to this state.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I shut up my shop, paid
him every attention, taking him to the bath, giving him my most beautiful
robes. I examined my accounts, and found that I had doubled my capital--that
is, that I now possessed two thousand sequins. I gave my brother half, saying:
&quot;Now, brother, you can forget your losses.&quot; He accepted them with
joy, and we lived together as we had before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some time afterwards my
second brother wished also to sell his business and travel. My eldest brother
and I did all we could to dissuade him, but it was of no use. He joined a
caravan and set out. He came back at the end of a year in the same state as his
elder brother. I took care of him, and as I had a thousand sequins to spare I
gave them to him, and he re-opened his shop. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day, my two brothers
came to me to propose that we should make a journey and trade. At first I
refused to go. &quot;You travelled,&quot; I said, &quot;and what did you
gain?&quot; But they came to me repeatedly, and after having held out for five
years I at last gave way. But when they had made their preparation, and they
began to buy the merchandise we needed, they found they had spent every piece
of the thousand sequins I had given them. I did not reproach them. I divided my
six thousand sequins with them, giving a thousand to each and keeping one for
myself, and the other three I buried in a corner of my house. We bought merchandise,
loaded a vessel with it, and set forth with a favorable wind. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After two months'
sailing we arrived at a seaport, where we disembarked and did a great trade.
Then we bought the merchandise of the country, and were just going to sail once
more, when I was stopped on the shore by a beautiful though poorly dressed
woman. She came up to me, kissed my hand, and implored me to marry her, and
take her on board. At first I refused, but she begged so hard and promised to
be such a good wife to me, that at last I consented. I got her some beautiful
dresses, and after having married her, we embarked and set sail. During the
voyage, I discovered so many good qualities in my wife that I began to love her
more and more. But my brothers began to be jealous of my prosperity, and set to
work to plot against my life. One night when we were sleeping they threw my
wife and myself into the sea. My wife, however, was a fairy, and so she did not
let me drown, but transported me to an island. When the day dawned, she said to
me, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When I saw you on
the sea-shore I took a great fancy to you, and wished to try your good nature,
so I presented myself in the disguise you saw. Now I have rewarded you by
saving your life. But I am very angry with your brothers, and I shall not rest
till I have taken their lives.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I thanked the fairy for
all that she had done for me, but I begged her not to kill my brothers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I appeased her wrath,
and in a moment she transported me from the island where we were to the roof of
my house, and she disappeared a moment afterwards. I went down, and opened the
doors, and dug up the three thousand sequins which I had buried. I went to the
place where my shop was, opened it, and received from my fellow-merchants
congratulations on my return. When I went home, I saw two black dogs who came
to meet me with sorrowful faces. I was much astonished, but the fairy who
reappeared said to me, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do not be
surprised to see these dogs; they are your two brothers. I have condemned them
to remain for ten years in these shapes.&quot; Then having told me where I
could hear news of her, she vanished. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The ten years are nearly
passed, and I am on the road to find her. As in passing I met this merchant and
the old man with the hind, I stayed with them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This is my history, O
prince of genii! Do you not think it is a most marvellous one? </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot;
replied the genius, &quot;and I will give up to you the third of the merchant's
punishment.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the third old man
made the genius the same request as the other two had done, and the genius
promised him the last third of the merchant's punishment if his story surpassed
both the others. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he told his story to
the genius, but I cannot tell you what it was, as I do not know. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But I do know that it
was even more marvellous than either of the others, so that the genius was
astonished, and said to the third old man, &quot;I will give up to you the
third part of the merchant's punishment. He ought to thank all three of you for
having interested yourselves in his favour. But for you, he would be here no
longer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying, he
disappeared, to the great joy of the company. The merchant did not fail to
thank his friends, and then each went on his way. The merchant returned to his
wife and children, and passed the rest of his days happily with them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sire, there was once
upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor that he could scarcely manage to
support his wife and three children. He went every day to fish very early, and
each day he made a rule not to throw his nets more than four times. He started
out one morning by moonlight and came to the sea-shore. He undressed and threw
his nets, and as he was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight.
He though he had caught a large fish, and he felt very pleased. But a moment
afterwards, seeing that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the carcase
of an ass, he was much disappointed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Vexed with having such a
bad haul, when he had mended his nets, which the carcase of the ass had broken
in several places, he threw them a second time. In drawing them in he again
felt a great weight, so that he thought they were full of fish. But he only
found a large basket full of rubbish. He was much annoyed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;O Fortune,&quot;
he cried, &quot;do not trifle thus with me, a poor fisherman, who can hardly
support his family!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying, he threw away
the rubbish, and after having washed his nets clean of the dirt, he threw them
for the third time. But he only drew in stones, shells, and mud. He was almost
in despair. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he threw his nets
for the fourth time. When he thought he had a fish he drew them in with a great
deal of trouble. There was no fish however, but he found a yellow pot, which by
its weight seemed full of something, and he noticed that it was fastened and
sealed with lead, with the impression of a seal. He was delighted. &quot;I will
sell it to the founder,&quot; he said; &quot;with the money I shall get for it
I shall buy a measure of wheat.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He examined the jar on
all sides; he shook it to see if it would rattle. But he heard nothing, and so,
judging from the impression of the seal and the lid, he thought there must be
something precious inside. To find out, he took his knife, and with a little
trouble he opened it. He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which
surprised him very much. He set it in front of him, and whilst he was looking
at it attentively, such a thick smoke came out that he had to step back a pace
or two. This smoke rose up to the clouds, and stretching over the sea and the
shore, formed a thick mist, which caused the fisherman much astonishment. When
all the smoke was out of the jar it gathered itself together, and became a
thick mass in which appeared a genius, twice as large as the largest giant.
When he saw such a terrible-looking monster, the fisherman would like to have
run away, but he trembled so with fright that he could not move a step. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Great king of the
genii,&quot; cried the monster, &quot;I will never again disobey you!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At these words the
fisherman took courage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What is this you
are saying, great genius? Tell me your history and how you came to be shut up
in that vase.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this, the genius
looked at the fisherman haughtily. &quot;Speak to me more civilly,&quot; he
said, &quot;before I kill you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas! why should

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No,&quot; answered
the genius; &quot;but that will not prevent me from killing you; and I am only
going to grant you one favour, and that is to choose the manner of your
death.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But what have I
done to you?&quot; asked the fisherman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I cannot treat you
in any other way,&quot; said the genius, &quot;and if you would know why,
listen to my story. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I rebelled against
the king of the genii. To punish me, he shut me up in this vase of copper, and
he put on the leaden cover his seal, which is enchantment enough to prevent my
coming out. Then he had the vase thrown into the sea. During the first period
of my captivity I vowed that if anyone should free me before a hundred years
were passed, I would make him rich even after his death. But that century
passed, and no one freed me. In the second century I vowed that I would give
all the treasures in the world to my deliverer; but he never came. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;In the third, I
promised to make him a king, to be always near him, and to grant him three
wishes every day; but that century passed away as the other two had done, and I
remained in the same plight. At last I grew angry at being captive for so long,
and I vowed that if anyone would release me I would kill him at once, and would
only allow him to choose in what manner he should die. So you see, as you have
freed me to-day, choose in what way you will die.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman was very unhappy.
&quot;What an unlucky man I am to have freed you! I implore you to spare my
life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have told
you,&quot; said the genius, &quot;that it is impossible. Choose quickly; you
are wasting time.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman began to
devise a plot. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Since I must
die,&quot; he said, &quot;before I choose the manner of my death, I conjure you
on your honour to tell me if you really were in that vase?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, I was,&quot;
answered the genius. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I really cannot
believe it,&quot; said the fisherman. &quot;That vase could not contain one of
your feet even, and how could your whole body go in? I cannot believe it unless
I see you do the thing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the genius began to
change himself into smoke, which, as before, spread over the sea and the shore,
and which, then collecting itself together, began to go back into the vase
slowly and evenly till there was nothing left outside. Then a voice came from
the vase which said to the fisherman, &quot;Well, unbelieving fisherman, here I
am in the vase; do you believe me now?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman instead of
answering took the lid of lead and shut it down quickly on the vase. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, O
genius,&quot; he cried, &quot;ask pardon of me, and choose by what death you
will die! But no, it will be better if I throw you into the sea whence I drew
you out, and I will build a house on the shore to warn fishermen who come to
cast their nets here, against fishing up such a wicked genius as you are, who
vows to kill the man who frees you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At these words the
genius did all he could to get out, but he could not, because of the
enchantment of the lid. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he tried to get out
by cunning. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you will take
off the cover,&quot; he said, &quot;I will repay you.&quot; </span></p>

you.&quot; </span></p>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the country of
Zouman, in Persia, there lived a Greek king. This king was a leper, and all his
doctors had been unable to cure him, when a very clever physician came to his
court. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was very learned in
all languages, and knew a great deal about herbs and medicines. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as he was told
of the king's illness he put on his best robe and presented himself before the
king. &quot;Sire,&quot; said he, &quot;I know that no physician has been able
to cure your majesty, but if you will follow my instructions, I will promise to
cure you without any medicines or outward application.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king listened to
this proposal. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you are clever
enough to do this,&quot; he said, &quot;I promise to make you and your
descendants rich for ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The physician went to
his house and made a polo club, the handle of which he hollowed out, and put in
it the drug he wished to use. Then he made a ball, and with these things he
went the next day to the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He told him that he
wished him to play at polo. Accordingly the king mounted his horse and went
into the place where he played. There the physician approached him with the bat
he had made, saying, &quot;Take this, sire, and strike the ball till you feel
your hand and whole body in a glow. When the remedy that is in the handle of
the club is warmed by your hand it will penetrate throughout your body. The you
must return to your palace, bathe, and go to sleep, and when you awake
to-morrow morning you will be cured.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king took the club
and urged his horse after the ball which he had thrown. He struck it, and then
it was hit back by the courtiers who were playing with him. When he felt very
hot he stopped playing, and went back to the palace, went into the bath, and
did all that the physician had said. The next day when he arose he found, to
his great joy and astonishment, that he was completely cured. When he entered
his audience-chamber all his courtiers, who were eager to see if the wonderful
cure had been effected, were overwhelmed with joy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The physician Douban
entered the hall and bowed low to the ground. The king, seeing him, called him,
made him sit by his side, and showed him every mark of honour. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That evening he gave him
a long and rich robe of state, and presented him with two thousand sequins. The
following day he continued to load him with favours. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the king had a
grand-vizir who was avaricious, and envious, and a very bad man. He grew
extremely jealous of the physician, and determined to bring about his ruin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In order to do this he
asked to speak in private with the king, saying that he had a most important
communication to make. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What is it?&quot;

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
answered the grand-vizir, &quot;it is most dangerous for a monarch to confide
in a man whose faithfulness is not proved, You do not know that this physician
is not a traitor come here to assassinate you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am sure,&quot;
said the king, &quot;that this man is the most faithful and virtuous of men. If
he wished to take my life, why did he cure me? Cease to speak against him. I
see what it is, you are jealous of him; but do not think that I can be turned
against him. I remember well what a vizir said to King Sindbad, his master, to
prevent him from putting the prince, his son, to death.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>What the Greek king said

Sindbad.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A good man had a
beautiful wife, whom he loved passionately, and never left if possible. One
day, when he was obliged by important business to go away from her, he went to
a place where all kinds of birds are sold and bought a parrot. This parrot not
only spoke well, but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before
it. He brought it home in a cage, and asked his wife to put it in her room, and
take great care of it while he was away. Then he departed. On his return he
asked the parrot what had happened during his absence, and the parrot told him
some things which made him scold his wife. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She thought that one of
her slaves must have been telling tales of her, but they told her it was the
parrot, and she resolved to revenge herself on him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When her husband next
went away for one day, she told on slave to turn under the bird's cage a
hand-mill; another to throw water down from above the cage, and a third to take
a mirror and turn it in front of its eyes, from left to right by the light of a
candle. The slaves did this for part of the night, and did it very well. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day when the
husband came back he asked the parrot what he had seen. The bird replied,
&quot;My good master, the lightning, thunder and rain disturbed me so much all
night long, that I cannot tell you what I have suffered.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The husband, who knew
that it had neither rained nor thundered in the night, was convinced that the
parrot was not speaking the truth, so he took him out of the cage and threw him
so roughly on the ground that he killed him. Nevertheless he was sorry
afterwards, for he found that the parrot had spoken the truth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When the Greek
king,&quot; said the fisherman to the genius, &quot;had finished the story of
the parrot, he added to the vizir, &quot;And so, vizir, I shall not listen to
you, and I shall take care of the physician, in case I repent as the husband
did when he had killed the parrot.&quot; But the vizir was determined.
&quot;Sire,&quot; he replied, &quot;the death of the parrot was nothing. But
when it is a question of the life of a king it is better to sacrifice the
innocent than save the guilty. It is no uncertain thing, however. The
physician, Douban, wishes to assassinate you. My zeal prompts me to disclose
this to your Majesty. If I am wrong, I deserve to be punished as a vizir was
once punished.&quot; &quot;What had the vizir done,&quot; said the Greek king,
&quot;to merit the punishment?&quot; &quot;I will tell your Majesty, if you

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was once upon a
time a king who had a son who was very fond of hunting. He often allowed him to
indulge in this pastime, but he had ordered his grand-vizir always to go with
him, and never to lose sight of him. One day the huntsman roused a stag, and
the prince, thinking that the vizir was behind, gave chase, and rode so hard
that he found himself alone. He stopped, and having lost sight of it, he turned
to rejoin the vizir, who had not been careful enough to follow him. But he lost
his way. Whilst he was trying to find it, he saw on the side of the road a
beautiful lady who was crying bitterly. He drew his horse's rein, and asked her
who she was and what she was doing in this place, and if she needed help.
&quot;I am the daughter of an Indian king,&quot; she answered, &quot;and whilst
riding in the country I fell asleep and tumbled off. My horse has run away, and
I do not know what has become of him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young prince had
pity on her, and offered to take her behind him, which he did. As they passed by
a ruined building the lady dismounted and went in. The prince also dismounted
and followed her. To his great surprise, he heard her saying to some one
inside, &quot;Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth.&quot;
And other voices replied, &quot;Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at
once, as we are very hungry?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince at once saw
the danger he was in. He now knew that the lady who said she was the daughter
of an Indian king was an ogress, who lived in desolate places, and who by a
thousand wiles surprised and devoured passers-by. He was terrified, and threw
himself on his horse. The pretended princess appeared at this moment, and
seeing that she had lost her prey, she said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid.
What do you want?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am lost,&quot;

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince could hardly
believe his ears, and rode off as hard as he could. He found his way, and
arrived safe and sound at his father's house, where he told him of the danger
he had run because of the grand-vizir's carelessness. The king was very angry,
and had him strangled immediately. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

on the vizir to the Greek king, &quot;to return to the physician, Douban. If
you do not take care, you will repent of having trusted him. Who knows what
this remedy, with which he has cured you, may not in time have a bad effect on
you?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

to say to the genius: &quot;You see what passed between the Greek king and the

knees, and bound, said to the king: &quot;At least let me put my affairs in
order, and leave my books to persons who will make good use of them. There is
one which I should like to present to your majesty. It is very precious, and ought
to be kept carefully in your treasury. It contains many curious things the
chief being that when you cut off my head, if your majesty will turn to the
sixth leaf, and read the third line of the left-hand page, my head will answer
all the questions you like to ask it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king, eager to see
such a wonderful thing, put off his execution to the next day, and sent him
under a strong guard to his house. There the physician put his affairs in
order, and the next day there was a great crowd assembled in the hall to see
his death, and the doings after it. The physician went up to the foot of the
throne with a large book in his hand. He carried a basin, on which he spread
the covering of the book, and presenting it to the king, said: &quot;Sire, take
this book, and when my head is cut off, let it be placed in the basin on the
covering of this book; as soon as it is there, the blood will cease to flow.
Then open the book, and my head will answer your questions. But, sire, I
implore your mercy, for I am innocent.&quot; </span></p>

cut off that it fell into the basin, and directly the blood ceased to flow.
Then, to the great astonishment of the king, the eyes opened, and the head
said, &quot;Your majesty, open the book.&quot; The king did so, and finding
that the first leaf stuck against the second, he put his finger in his mouth,
to turn it more easily. He did the same thing till he reached the sixth page,
and not seeing any writing on it, &quot;Physician,&quot; he said, &quot;there
is no writing.&quot; </span></p>

his finger in his mouth, till the poison in which each page was dipped took

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the physician's
head saw that the poison had taken effect, and that the king had only a few
more minutes to live, &quot;Tyrant,&quot; it cried, &quot;see how cruelty and
injustice are punished.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarcely had it uttered
these words than the king died, and the head lost also the little life that had
remained in it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That is the end of the
story of the Greek king, and now let us return to the fisherman and the genius.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If the Greek
king,&quot; said the fisherman, &quot;had spared the physician, he would not
have thus died. The same thing applies to you. Now I am going to throw you into
the sea.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friend,&quot;
said the genius, &quot;do not do such a cruel thing. Do not treat me as Imma
treated Ateca.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What did Imma do
to Ateca?&quot; asked the fisherman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you think I can
tell you while I am shut up in here?&quot; replied the genius. &quot;Let me
out, and I will make you rich.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The hope of being no
longer poor made the fisherman give way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you will give
me your promise to do this, I will open the lid. I do not think you will dare
to break your word.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The genius promised, and
the fisherman lifted the lid. He came out at once in smoke, and then, having
resumed his proper form, the first thing he did was to kick the vase into the
sea. This frightened the fisherman, but the genius laughed and said, &quot;Do
not be afraid; I only did it to frighten you, and to show you that I intend to
keep my word; take your nets and follow me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He began to walk in
front of the fisherman, who followed him with some misgivings. They passed in
front of the town, and went up a mountain and then down into a great plain,
where there was a large lake lying between four hills. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they reached the
lake the genius said to the fisherman, &quot;Throw your nets and catch
fish.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman did as he
was told, hoping for a good catch, as he saw plenty of fish. What was his
astonishment at seeing that there were four quite different kinds, some white,
some red, some blue, and some yellow. He caught four, one of each colour. As he
had never seen any like them he admired them very much, and he was very pleased
to think how much money he would get for them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take these fish
and carry them to the Sultan, who will give you more money for them than you
have ever had in your life. You can come every day to fish in this lake, but be
careful not to throw your nets more than once every day, otherwise some harm
will happen to you. If you follow my advice carefully you will find it
good.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Saying these words, he
struck his foot against the ground, which opened, and when he had disappeared,
it closed immediately. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman resolved
to obey the genius exactly, so he did not cast his nets a second time, but
walked into the town to sell his fish at the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Sultan saw the
fish he was much astonished. He looked at them one after the other, and when he
had admired them long enough, &quot;Take these fish,&quot; he said to his first
vizir, &quot;and given them to the clever cook the Emperor of the Greeks sent
me. I think they must be as good as they are beautiful.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir took them
himself to the cook, saying, &quot;Here are four fish that have been brought to
the Sultan. He wants you to cook them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he went back to the
Sultan, who told him to give the fisherman four hundred gold pieces. The
fisherman, who had never before possessed such a large sum of money at once,
could hardly believe his good fortune. He at once relieved the needs of his
family, and made good use of it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But now we must return
to the kitchen, which we shall find in great confusion. The cook, when she had
cleaned the fish, put them in a pan with some oil to fry them. When she thought
them cooked enough on one side she turned them on the other. But scarcely had
she done so when the walls of the kitchen opened, and there came out a young
and beautiful damsel. She was dressed in an Egyptian dress of flowered satin,
and she wore earrings, and a necklace of white pearls, and bracelets of gold
set with rubies, and she held a wand of myrtle in her hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She went up to the pan,
to the great astonishment of the cook, who stood motionless at the sight of
her. She struck one of the fish with her rod, &quot;Fish, fish,&quot; said she,
&quot;are you doing your duty?&quot; The fish answered nothing, and then she
repeated her question, whereupon they all raised their heads together and
answered very distinctly, &quot;Yes, yes. If you reckon, we reckon. If you pay
your debts, we pay ours. If you fly, we conquer, and we are content.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they had spoken the
girl upset the pan, and entered the opening in the wall, which at once closed,
and appeared the same as before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the cook had
recovered from her fright she lifted up the fish which had fallen into the
ashes, but she found them as black as cinders, and not fit to serve up to the
Sultan. She began to cry. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas! what shall I
say to the Sultan? He will be so angry with me, and I know he will not believe
me!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst she was crying
the grand-vizir came in and asked if the fish were ready. She told him all that
had happened, and he was much surprised. He sent at once for the fisherman, and
when he came said to him, &quot;Fisherman, bring me four more fish like you
have brought already, for an accident has happened to them so that they cannot
be served up to the Sultan.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman did not
say what the genius had told him, but he excused himself from bringing them
that day on account of the length of the way, and he promised to bring them
next day. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the night he went to
the lake, cast his nets, and on drawing them in found four fish, which were
like the others, each of a different colour. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He went back at once and
carried them to the grand-vizir as he had promised. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He then took them to the
kitchen and shut himself up with the cook, who began to cook them as she had
done the four others on the previous day. When she was about to turn them on
the other side, the wall opened, the damsel appeared, addressed the same words
to the fish, received the same answer, and then overturned the pan and
disappeared. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir was
filled with astonishment. &quot;I shall tell the Sultan all that has
happened,&quot; said he. And he did so. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was very much
astounded, and wished to see this marvel for himself. So he sent for the
fisherman, and asked him to procure four more fish. The fisherman asked for
three days, which were granted, and he then cast his nets in the lake, and
again caught four different coloured fish. The sultan was delighted to see he
had got them, and gave him again four hundred gold pieces. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as the Sultan
had the fish he had them carried to his room with all that was needed to cook
them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he shut himself up
with the grand-vizir, who began to prepare them and cook them. When they were
done on one side he turned them over on the other. Then the wall of the room
opened, but instead of the maiden a black slave came out. He was enormously
tall, and carried a large green stick with which he touched the fish, saying in
a terrible voice, &quot;Fish, fish, are you doing your duty?&quot; To these
words the fish lifting up their heads replied, &quot;Yes, yes. If you reckon,
we reckon. If you pay your debts, we pay ours. If you fly, we conquer, and are
content.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The black slave
overturned the pan in the middle of the room, and the fish were turned to
cinders. Then he stepped proudly back into the wall, which closed round him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;After having seen
this,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;I cannot rest. These fish signify some
mystery I must clear up.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He sent for the
fisherman. &quot;Fisherman,&quot; he said, &quot;the fish you have brought us
have caused me some anxiety. Where did you get them from?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; he
answered, &quot;I got them from a lake which lies in the middle of four hills
beyond yonder mountains.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you know this
lake?&quot; asked the Sultan of the grand-vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No; though I have
hunted many times round that mountain, I have never heard of it,&quot; said the
vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As the fisherman said it
was only three hours' journey away, the sultan ordered his whole court to mount
and ride thither, and the fisherman led them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They climbed the
mountain, and then, on the other side, saw the lake as the fisherman had
described. The water was so clear that they could see the four kinds of fish
swimming about in it. They looked at them for some time, and then the Sultan
ordered them to make a camp by the edge of the water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When night came the
Sultan called his vizir, and said to him, &quot;I have resolved to clear up
this mystery. I am going out alone, and do you stay here in my tent, and when
my ministers come to-morrow, say I am not well, and cannot see them. Do this
each day till I return.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir tried to
persuade the Sultan not to go, but in vain. The Sultan took off his state robe
and put on his sword, and when he saw all was quiet in the camp he set forth
alone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He climbed one of the
hills, and then crossed the great plain, till, just as the sun rose, he beheld
far in front of him a large building. When he came near to it he saw it was a
splendid palace of beautiful black polished marble, covered with steel as smooth
as a mirror. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He went to the gate,
which stood half open, and went in, as nobody came when he knocked. He passed
through a magnificent courtyard and still saw no one, though he called aloud
several times. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He entered large halls
where the carpets were of silk, the lounges and sofas covered with tapestry
from Mecca, and the hangings of the most beautiful Indian stuffs of gold and
silver. Then he found himself in a splendid room, with a fountain supported by
golden lions. The water out of the lions' mouths turned into diamonds and
pearls, and the leaping water almost touched a most beautifully-painted dome.
The palace was surrounded on three sides by magnificent gardens, little lakes,
and woods. Birds sang in the trees, which were netted over to keep them always
there. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Still the Sultan saw no
one, till he heard a plaintive cry, and a voice which said, &quot;Oh that I
could die, for I am too unhappy to wish to live any longer!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan looked round
to discover who it was who thus bemoaned his fate, and at last saw a handsome
young man, richly clothed, who was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the
ground. His face was very sad. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sultan approached
him and bowed to him. The young man bent his head very low, but did not rise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; he
said to the Sultan, &quot;I cannot rise and do you the reverence that I am sure
should be paid to your rank.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir,&quot;
answered the Sultan, &quot;I am sure you have a good reason for not doing so,
and having heard your cry of distress, I am come to offer you my help. Whose is
this palace, and why is it thus empty?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Instead of answering the
young man lifted up his robe, and showed the Sultan that, from the waist
downwards, he was a block of black marble. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was
horrified, and begged the young man to tell him his story. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Willingly I will
tell you my sad history,&quot; said the young man. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>You must know, sire,
that my father was Mahmoud, the king of this country, the Black Isles, so
called from the four little mountains which were once islands, while the
capital was the place where now the great lake lies. My story will tell you how
these changes came about. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My father died when he
was sixty-six, and I succeeded him. I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly,
and I thought she loved me too. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But one afternoon, when
I was half asleep, and was being fanned by two of her maids, I heard one say to
the other, &quot;What a pity it is that our mistress no longer loves our
master! I believe she would like to kill him if she could, for she is an enchantress.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I soon found by watching
that they were right, and when I mortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for
a great crime, she begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where
she wept and bewailed him for two years. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last I begged her to
cease grieving for him, for although he could not speak or move, by her
enchantments she just kept him alive. She turned upon me in a rage, and said
over me some magic words, and I instantly became as you see me now, half man
and half marble. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then this wicked
enchantress changed the capital, which was a very populous and flourishing
city, into the lake and desert plain you saw. The fish of four colours which
are in it are the different races who lived in the town; the four hills are the
four islands which give the name to my kingdom. All this the enchantress told
me to add to my troubles. And this is not all. Every day she comes and beats me
with a whip of buffalo hide. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the young king had
finished his sad story he burst once more into tears, and the Sultan was much
moved. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell me,&quot; he
cried, &quot;where is this wicked woman, and where is the miserable object of
her affection, whom she just manages to keep alive?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Where she lives I
do not know,&quot; answered the unhappy prince, &quot;but she goes every day at
sunrise to see if the slave can yet speak to her, after she has beaten
me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Unfortunate
king,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;I will do what I can to avenge you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he consulted with the
young king over the best way to bring this about, and they agreed their plan should
be put in effect the next day. The Sultan then rested, and the young king gave
himself up to happy hopes of release. The next day the Sultan arose, and then
went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was. He drew his sword
and destroyed the little life that remained in him, and then threw the body
down a well. He then lay down on the couch where the slave had been, and waited
for the enchantress. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She went first to the
young king, whom she beat with a hundred blows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then she came to the room
where she thought her wounded slave was, but where the Sultan really lay. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She came near his couch
and said, &quot;Are you better to-day, my dear slave? Speak but one word to
me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How can I be
better,&quot; answered the Sultan, imitating the language of the Ethiopians,
&quot;when I can never sleep for the cries and groans of your husband?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What joy to hear
you speak!&quot; answered the queen. &quot;Do you wish him to regain his proper
shape?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said
the Sultan; &quot;hasten to set him at liberty, so that I may no longer hear
his cries.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The queen at once went
out and took a cup of water, and said over it some words that made it boil as
if it were on the fire. Then she threw it over the prince, who at once regained
his own form. He was filled with joy, but the enchantress said, &quot;Hasten
away from this place and never come back, lest I kill you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So he hid himself to see
the end of the Sultan's plan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The enchantress went
back to the Palace of Tears and said, &quot;Now I have done what you
wished.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What you have
done,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;is not enough to cure me. Every day at
midnight all the people whom you have changed into fish lift their heads out of
the lake and cry for vengeance. Go quickly, and give them their proper

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The enchantress hurried
away and said some words over the lake. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fish then became
men, women, and children, and the houses and shops were once more filled. The
Sultan's suite, who had encamped by the lake, were not a little astonished to
see themselves in the middle of a large and beautiful town. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as she had
disenchanted it the queen went back to the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Are you quite well
now?&quot; she said. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Come near,&quot;
said the Sultan. &quot;Nearer still.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She obeyed. Then he
sprang up, and with one blow of his sword he cut her in two. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he went and found
the prince. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Rejoice,&quot; he
said, &quot;your cruel enemy is dead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince thanked him
again and again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And now,&quot;
said the Sultan. &quot;I will go back to my capital, which I am glad to find is
so near yours.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;So near
mine!&quot; said the King of the Black Isles. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you know it is
a whole year's journey from here? You came here in a few hours because it was
enchanted. But I will accompany you on your journey.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It will give me
much pleasure if you will escort me,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;and as I have
no children, I will make you my heir.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan and the
prince set out together, the Sultan laden with rich presents from the King of
the Black Isles. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The day after he reached
his capital the Sultan assembled his court and told them all that had befallen
him, and told them how he intended to adopt the young king as his heir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he gave each man
presents in proportion to his rank. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As for the fisherman, as
he was the first cause of the deliverance of the young prince, the Sultan gave
him much money, and made him and his family happy for the rest of their days. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Three Calenders,
Sons of Kings, and of Five Ladies of Bagdad</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the reign of the
Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived at Bagdad a porter who, in spite of his
humble calling, was an intelligent and sensible man. One morning he was sitting
in his usual place with his basket before him, waiting to be hired, when a tall
young lady, covered with a long muslin veil, came up to him and said,
&quot;Pick up your basket and follow me.&quot; The porter, who was greatly
pleased by her appearance and voice, jumped up at once, poised his basket on
his head, and accompanied the lady, saying to himself as he went, &quot;Oh,
happy day! Oh, lucky meeting!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The lady soon stopped
before a closed door, at which she knocked. It was opened by an old man with a
long white beard, to whom the lady held out money without speaking. The old
man, who seemed to understand what she wanted, vanished into the house, and
returned bringing a large jar of wine, which the porter placed in his basket.
Then the lady signed to him to follow, and they went their way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next place she
stopped at was a fruit and flower shop, and here she bought a large quantity of
apples, apricots, peaches, and other things, with lilies, jasmine, and all
sorts of sweet-smelling plants. From this shop she went to a butcher's, a
grocer's, and a poulterer's, till at last the porter exclaimed in despair,
&quot;My good lady, if you had only told me you were going to buy enough
provisions to stock a town, I would have brought a horse, or rather a
camel.&quot; The lady laughed, and told him she had not finished yet, but after
choosing various kinds of scents and spices from a druggist's store, she halted
before a magnificent palace, at the door of which she knocked gently. The
porteress who opened it was of such beauty that the eyes of the man were quite
dazzled, and he was the more astonished as he saw clearly that she was no
slave. The lady who had led him hither stood watching him with amusement, till
the porteress exclaimed, &quot;Why don't you come in, my sister? This poor man
is so heavily weighed down that he is ready to drop.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they were both
inside the door was fastened, and they all three entered a large court,
surrounded by an open-work gallery. At one end of the court was a platform, and
on the platform stood an amber throne supported by four ebony columns,
garnished with pearls and diamonds. In the middle of the court stood a marble
basin filled with water from the mouth of a golden lion. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The porter looked about
him, noticing and admiring everything; but his attention was specially
attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne, who was even more beautiful
than the other two. By the respect shown to her by the others, he judged that
she must be the eldest, and in this he was right. This lady's name was Zobeida,
the porteress was Sadie, and the housekeeper was Amina. At a word from Zobeida,
Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter, who was glad enough to be
relieved from its weight; and when it was emptied, paid him handsomely for its
use. But instead of taking up his basket and going away, the man still
lingered, till Zobeida inquired what he was waiting for, and if he expected
more money. &quot;Oh, madam,&quot; returned he, &quot;you have already given me
too much, and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my
departure at once. But, if you will pardon my saying so, I was lost in
astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves. A company of women
without men is, however, as dull as a company of men without women.&quot; And
after telling some stories to prove his point, he ended by entreating them to
let him stay and make a fourth at their dinner. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The ladies were rather
amused at the man's assurances and after some discussion it was agreed that he
should be allowed to stay, as his society might prove entertaining. &quot;But
listen, friend,&quot; said Zobeida, &quot;if we grant your request, it is only
on condition that you behave with the utmost politeness, and that you keep the
secret of our way of living, which chance has revealed to you.&quot; Then they
all sat down to table, which had been covered by Amina with the dishes she had
bought. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After the first few
mouthfuls Amina poured some wine into a golden cup. She first drank herself,
according to the Arab custom, and then filled it for her sisters. When it came
to the porter's turn he kissed Amina's hand, and sang a song, which he composed
at the moment in praise of the wine. The three ladies were pleased with the
song, and then sang themselves, so that the repast was a merry one, and lasted
much longer than usual. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length, seeing that
the sun was about to set, Sadia said to the porter, &quot;Rise and go; it is
now time for us to separate.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, madam,&quot;
replied he, &quot;how can you desire me to quit you in the state in which I am?
Between the wine I have drunk, and the pleasure of seeing you, I should never
find the way to my house. Let me remain here till morning, and when I have
recovered my senses I will go when you like.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let him
stay,&quot; said Amina, who had before proved herself his friend. &quot;It is
only just, as he has given us so much amusement.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you wish it, my
sister,&quot; replied Zobeida; &quot;but if he does, I must make a new
condition. Porter,&quot; she continued, turning to him, &quot;if you remain,
you must promise to ask no questions about anything you may see. If you do, you
may perhaps hear what you don't like.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This being settled,
Amina brought in supper, and lit up the hall with a number of sweet smelling
tapers. They then sat down again at the table, and began with fresh appetites to
eat, drink, sing, and recite verses. In fact, they were all enjoying themselves
mightily when they heard a knock at the outer door, which Sadie rose to open.
She soon returned saying that three Calenders, all blind in the right eye, and
all with their heads, faces, and eyebrows clean shaved, begged for admittance,
as they were newly arrived in Bagdad, and night had already fallen. &quot;They
seem to have pleasant manners,&quot; she added, &quot;but you have no idea how
funny they look. I am sure we should find their company diverting.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Zobeida and Amina made
some difficulty about admitting the new comers, and Sadie knew the reason of
their hesitation. But she urged the matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last
forced to consent. &quot;Bring them in, then,&quot; said she, &quot;but make
them understand that they are not to make remarks about what does not concern
them, and be sure to make them read the inscription over the door.&quot; For on
the door was written in letters of gold, &quot;Whoso meddles in affairs that
are no business of his, will hear truths that will not please him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The three Calenders
bowed low on entering, and thanked the ladies for their kindness and
hospitality. The ladies replied with words of welcome, and they were all about
to seat themselves when the eyes of the Calenders fell on the porter, whose
dress was not so very unlike their own, though he still wore all the hair that
nature had given him. &quot;This,&quot; said one of them, &quot;is apparently
one of our Arab brothers, who has rebelled against our ruler.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The porter, although
half asleep from the wine he had drunk, heard the words, and without moving
cried angrily to the Calender, &quot;Sit down and mind your own business. Did
you not read the inscription over the door? Everybody is not obliged to live in
the same way.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do not be so
angry, my good man,&quot; replied the Calender; &quot;we should be very sorry
to displease you;&quot; so the quarrel was smoothed over, and supper began in
good earnest. When the Calenders had satisfied their hunger, they offered to
play to their hostesses, if there were any instruments in the house. The ladies
were delighted at the idea, and Sadie went to see what she could find,
returning in a few moments laden with two different kinds of flutes and a
tambourine. Each Calender took the one he preferred, and began to play a
well-known air, while the ladies sang the words of the song. These words were
the gayest and liveliest possible, and every now and then the singers had to
stop to indulge the laughter which almost choked them. In the midst of all
their noise, a knock was heard at the door. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now early that evening
the Caliph secretly left the palace, accompanied by his grand-vizir, Giafar,
and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs, all three wearing the dresses of merchants.
Passing down the street, the Caliph had been attracted by the music of
instruments and the sound of laughter, and had ordered his vizir to go and
knock at the door of the house, as he wished to enter. The vizir replied that
the ladies who lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends, and he
thought his master would do well not to intrude on them; but the Caliph had
taken it into his head to see for himself, and insisted on being obeyed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The knock was answered
by Sadie, with a taper in her hand, and the vizir, who was surprised at her
beauty, bowed low before her, and said respectfully, &quot;Madam, we are three
merchants who have lately arrived from Moussoul, and, owing to a misadventure
which befel us this very night, only reached our inn to find that the doors
were closed to us till to-morrow morning. Not knowing what to do, we wandered
in the streets till we happened to pass your house, when, seeing lights and
hearing the sound of voices, we resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the
dawn. If you will grant us this favour, we will, with your permission, do all
in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sadie answered the
merchant that she must first consult her sisters; and after having talked over
the matter with them, she returned to tell him that he and his two friends
would be welcome to join their company. They entered and bowed politely to the
ladies and their guests. Then Zobeida, as the mistress, came forward and said
gravely, &quot;You are welcome here, but I hope you will allow me to beg one
thing of you--have as many eyes as you like, but no tongues; and ask no
questions about anything you see, however strange it may appear to you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot;
returned the vizir, &quot;you shall be obeyed. We have quite enough to please
and interest us without troubling ourselves about that with which we have no
concern.&quot; Then they all sat down, and drank to the health of the new
comers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While the vizir, Giafar,
was talking to the ladies the Caliph was occupied in wondering who they could
be, and why the three Calenders had each lost his right eye. He was burning to
inquire the reason of it all, but was silenced by Zobeida's request, so he
tried to rouse himself and to take his part in the conversation, which was very
lively, the subject of discussion being the many different sorts of pleasures
that there were in the world. After some time the Calenders got up and
performed some curious dances, which delighted the rest of the company. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they had finished
Zobeida rose from her seat, and, taking Amina by the hand, she said to her,
&quot;My sister, our friends will excuse us if we seem to forget their presence
and fulfil our nightly task.&quot; Amina understood her sister's meaning, and
collecting the dishes, glasses, and musical instruments, she carried them away,
while Sadie swept the hall and put everything in order. Having done this she
begged the Calenders to sit on a sofa on one side of the room, and the Caliph
and his friends to place themselves opposite. As to the porter, she requested
him to come and help her and her sister. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Shortly after Amina
entered carrying a seat, which she put down in the middle of the empty space.
She next went over to the door of a closet and signed to the porter to follow
her. He did so, and soon reappeared leading two black dogs by a chain, which he
brought into the centre of the hall. Zobeida then got up from her seat between
the Calenders and the Caliph and walked slowly across to where the porter stood
with the dogs. &quot;We must do our duty,&quot; she said with a deep sigh,
pushing back her sleeves, and, taking a whip from Sadie, she said to the man,
&quot;Take one of those dogs to my sister Amina and give me the other.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The porter did as he was
bid, but as he led the dog to Zobeida it uttered piercing howls, and gazed up
at her with looks of entreaty. But Zobeida took no notice, and whipped the dog
till she was out of breath. She then took the chain from the porter, and,
raising the dog on its hind legs, they looked into each other's eyes
sorrowfully till tears began to fall from both. Then Zobeida took her
handkerchief and wiped the dog's eyes tenderly, after which she kissed it,
then, putting the chain into the porter's hand she said, &quot;Take it back to
the closet and bring me the other.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The same ceremony was
gone through with the second dog, and all the while the whole company looked on
with astonishment. The Caliph in particular could hardly contain himself, and
made signs to the vizir to ask what it all meant. But the vizir pretended not
to see, and turned his head away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Zobeida remained for
some time in the middle of the room, till at last Sadie went up to her and
begged her to sit down, as she also had her part to play. At these words Amina
fetched a lute from a case of yellow satin and gave it to Sadie, who sang
several songs to its accompaniment. When she was tired she said to Amina, &quot;My
sister, I can do no more; come, I pray you, and take my place.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Amina struck a few
chords and then broke into a song, which she sang with so much ardour that she
was quite overcome, and sank gasping on a pile of cushions, tearing open her
dress as she did so to give herself some air. To the amazement of all present,
her neck, instead of being as smooth and white as her face, was a mass of
scars. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Calenders and the
Caliph looked at each other, and whispered together, unheard by Zobeida and
Sadie, who were tending their fainting sister. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What does it all
mean?' asked the Caliph. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We know no more
than you,&quot; said the Calender to whom he had spoken. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What! You do not
belong to the house?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot;
answered all the Calenders together, &quot;we came here for the first time an
hour before you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They then turned to the
porter to see if he could explain the mystery, but the porter was no wiser than
they were themselves. At length the Caliph could contain his curiosity no
longer, and declared that he would compel the ladies to tell them the meaning
of their strange conduct. The vizir, foreseeing what would happen, implored him
to remember the condition their hostesses had imposed, and added in a whisper
that if his Highness would only wait till morning he could as Caliph summon the
ladies to appear before him. But the Caliph, who was not accustomed to be
contradicted, rejected this advice, and it was resolved after a little more
talking that the question should be put by the porter. Suddenly Zobeida turned
round, and seeing their excitement she said, &quot;What is the matter--what are
you all discussing so earnestly?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot;
answered the porter, &quot;these gentlemen entreat you to explain to them why
you should first whip the dogs and then cry over them, and also how it happens
that the fainting lady is covered with scars. They have requested me, Madam, to
be their mouthpiece.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Is it true,
gentlemen,&quot; asked Zobeida, drawing herself up, &quot;that you have charged
this man to put me that question?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is,&quot; they
all replied, except Giafar, who was silent. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Is this,&quot;
continued Zobeida, growing more angry every moment, &quot;is this the return
you make for the hospitality I have shown you? Have you forgotten the one
condition on which you were allowed to enter the house? Come quickly,&quot; she
added, clapping her hands three times, and the words were hardly uttered when
seven black slaves, each armed with a sabre, burst in and stood over the seven
men, throwing them on the ground, and preparing themselves, on a sign from
their mistress, to cut off their heads. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The seven culprits all
thought their last hour had come, and the Caliph repented bitterly that he had
not taken the vizir's advice. But they made up their minds to die bravely, all
except the porter, who loudly inquired of Zobeida why he was to suffer for
other people's faults, and declared that these misfortunes would never have
happened if it had not been for the Calenders, who always brought ill-luck. He
ended by imploring Zobeida not to confound the innocent with the guilty and to
spare his life. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In spite of her anger,
there was something so comic in the groans of the porter that Zobeida could not
refrain from laughing. But putting him aside she addressed the others a second
time, saying, &quot;Answer me; who are you? Unless you tell me truly you have
not another moment to live. I can hardly think you are men of any position,
whatever country you belong to. If you were, you would have had more
consideration for us.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph, who was
naturally very impatient, suffered far more than either of the others at
feeling that his life was at the mercy of a justly offended lady, but when he
heard her question he began to breathe more freely, for he was convinced that
she had only to learn his name and rank for all danger to be over. So he whispered
hastily to the vizir, who was next to him, to reveal their secret. But the
vizir, wiser than his master, wished to conceal from the public the affront

we deserved.&quot; </span></p>

turned to the three Calenders and inquired if, as they were all blind, they
were brothers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

replied one, &quot;we are no blood relations at all, only brothers by our mode
of life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And you,&quot; she

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, madam,&quot;
returned he, &quot;I became blind through a most surprising adventure, such as
probably has never happened to anybody. After that I shaved my head and
eyebrows and put on the dress in which you see me now.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Zobeida put the same
question to the other two Calenders, and received the same answer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; added
the third, &quot;it may interest you, madam, to know that we are not men of low
birth, but are all three sons of kings, and of kings, too, whom the world holds
in high esteem.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At these words Zobeida's
anger cooled down, and she turned to her slaves and said, &quot;You can give
them a little more liberty, but do not leave the hall. Those that will tell us
their histories and their reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave
unhurt; those who refuse--&quot; And she paused, but in a moment the porter,
who understood that he had only to relate his story to set himself free from
this terrible danger, immediately broke in, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam, you know
already how I came here, and what I have to say will soon be told. Your sister
found me this morning in the place where I always stand waiting to be hired.
She bade me follow her to various shops, and when my basket was quite full we
returned to this house, when you had the goodness to permit me to remain, for
which I shall be eternally grateful. That is my story.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He looked anxiously to
Zobeida, who nodded her head and said, &quot;You can go; and take care we never
meet again.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, madam,&quot;
cried the porter, &quot;let me stay yet a little while. It is not just that the
others should have heard my story and that I should not hear theirs,&quot; and
without waiting for permission he seated himself on the end of the sofa
occupied by the ladies, whilst the rest crouched on the carpet, and the slaves
stood against the wall. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then one of the
Calenders, addressing himself to Zobeida as the principal lady, began his

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In order, madam, to
explain how I came to lose my right eye, and to wear the dress of a Calender,
you must first know that I am the son of a king. My father's only brother
reigned over the neighbouring country, and had two children, a daughter and a
son, who were of the same age as myself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As I grew up, and was
allowed more liberty, I went every year to pay a visit to my uncle's court, and
usually stayed there about two months. In this way my cousin and I became very
intimate, and were much attached to each other. The very last time I saw him he
seemed more delighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my honour.
When we had finished eating, he said to me, &quot;My cousin, you would never
guess what I have been doing since your last visit to us! Directly after your
departure I set a number of men to work on a building after my own design. It
is now completed, and ready to be lived in. I should like to show it to you,
but you must first swear two things: to be faithful to me, and to keep my
secret.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Of course I did not
dream of refusing him anything he asked, and gave the promise without the least
hesitation. He then bade me wait an instant, and vanished, returning in a few
moments with a richly dressed lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me
her name, I thought it was better not to inquire. We all three sat down to
table and amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things, and
with drinking each other's health. Suddenly the prince said to me,
&quot;Cousin, we have no time to lose; be so kind as to conduct this lady to a
certain spot, where you will find a dome-like tomb, newly built. You cannot
mistake it. Go in, both of you, and wait till I come. I shall not be
long.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As I had promised I
prepared to do as I was told, and giving my hand to the lady, I escorted her,
by the light of the moon, to the place of which the prince had spoken. We had
barely reached it when he joined us himself, carrying a small vessel of water,
a pickaxe, and a little bag containing plaster. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With the pickaxe he at
once began to destroy the empty sepulchre in the middle of the tomb. One by one
he took the stones and piled them up in a corner. When he had knocked down the
whole sepulchre he proceeded to dig at the earth, and beneath where the
sepulchre had been I saw a trap-door. He raised the door and I caught sight of
the top of a spiral staircase; then he said, turning to the lady, &quot;Madam,
this is the way that will lead you down to the spot which I told you of.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The lady did not answer,
but silently descended the staircase, the prince following her. At the top,
however, he looked at me. &quot;My cousin,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I do not
know how to thank you for your kindness. Farewell.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He would say no more,
and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my room in the palace and went to bed. When
I woke, and considered my adventure, I thought that I must have been dreaming,
and sent a servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me. But on
hearing that he had not slept at home I was much alarmed, and hastened to the
cemetery, where, unluckily, the tombs were all so alike that I could not
discover which was the one I was in search of, though I spent four days in
looking for it. </span></p>

this time the king, my uncle, was absent on a hunting expedition, and as no one
knew when he would be back, I at last decided to return home, leaving the
ministers to make my excuses. I longed to tell them what had become of the
prince, about whose fate they felt the most dreadful anxiety, but the oath I
had sworn kept me silent. </span></p>

father's capital, I was astonished to find a large detachment of guards drawn
up before the gate of the palace; they surrounded me directly I entered. I
asked the officers in command the reason of this strange behaviour, and was
horrified to learn that the army had mutinied and put to death the king, my
father, and had placed the grand-vizir on the throne. Further, that by his
orders I was placed under arrest. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:26.25pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now this rebel vizir had
hated me from my boy-hood, because once, when shooting at a bird with a bow, I
had shot out his eye by accident. Of course I not only sent a servant at once
to offer him my regrets and apologies, but I made them in person. It was all of
no use. He cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no occasion of
showing it. Having once got me in his power I felt he could show no mercy, and
I was right. Mad with triumph and fury he came to me in my prison and tore out
my right eye. That is how I lost it. </span></p>

did not stop here. He shut me up in a large case and ordered his executioner to
carry me into a desert place, to cut off my head, and then to abandon my body
to the birds of prey. The case, with me inside it, was accordingly placed on a
horse, and the executioner, accompanied by another man, rode into the country
until they found a spot suitable for the purpose. But their hearts were not so
hard as they seemed, and my tears and prayers made them waver. </span></p>

kingdom instantly,&quot; said the executioner at last, &quot;and take care
never to come back, for you will not only lose your head, but make us lose
ours.&quot; I thanked him gratefully, and tried to console myself for the loss
of my eye by thinking of the other misfortunes I had escaped. </span></p>

kingdom of my uncle, of whose protection I was sure. </span></p>

trouble about the disappearance of his son, who had, he said, vanished without
leaving a trace; but his own grief did not prevent him sharing mine. We mingled
our tears, for the loss of one was the loss of the other, and then I made up my
mind that it was my duty to break the solemn oath I had sworn to the prince. I
therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything I knew, and I observed
that even before I had ended his sorrow appeared to be lightened a little. </span></p>

keep the matter secret, let us go alone and seek the place ourselves.&quot; </span></p>

myself, and we both slipped out of a garden door which opened on to the
cemetery. It did not take long for us to arrive at the scene of the prince's
disappearance, or to discover the tomb I had sought so vainly before. We
entered it, and found the trap-door which led to the staircase, but we had
great difficulty in raising it, because the prince had fastened it down
underneath with the plaster he had brought with him. </span></p>

I followed him. When we reached the bottom of the stairs we stepped into a sort
of ante-room, filled with such a dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see
anything. However, we passed through the smoke into a large chamber, which at
first seemed quite empty. The room was brilliantly lighted, and in another
moment we perceived a sort of platform at one end, on which were the bodies of
the prince and a lady, both half-burned, as if they had been dragged out of a
fire before it had quite consumed them. </span></p>

impossible he should ever marry. I tried to turn his thoughts, and presented to
him the most beautiful princesses, but he cared for none of them, and, as you
see, they have now been united by a horrible death in an underground
tomb.&quot; But, as he spoke, his anger melted into tears, and again I wept
with him. </span></p>

drums, and cymbals, and the blare of trumpets burst upon our astonished ears.

had dethroned my father, and was come to seize the kingdom of my uncle. </span></p>

ill-fortune, and stricken with grief, there seemed to be only one means of
safety left to me. I shaved my beard and my eyebrows, and put on the dress of a
calender, in which it was easy for me to travel without being known. I avoided
the towns till I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph,
Haroun-al-Raschid, when I had no further reason to fear my enemies. It was my
intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness,
who would, I felt certain, be touched by my sad story, and would grant me,

other calender, who stopped to greet me. &quot;You, like me, appear to be a
stranger,&quot; I said. He replied that I was right, and before he could say
more the third calender came up. He, also, was newly arrived in Bagdad, and
being brothers in misfortune, we resolved to cast in our lots together, and to

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was scarcely more than
a baby, when the king my father, finding me unusually quick and clever for my
age, turned his thoughts to my education. I was taught first to read and write,
and then to learn the Koran, which is the basis of our holy religion, and the
better to understand it, I read with my tutors the ablest commentators on its
teaching, and committed to memory all the traditions respecting the Prophet,
which have been gathered from the mouth of those who were his friends. I also
learnt history, and was instructed in poetry, versification, geography,
chronology, and in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should
excel. But what I liked best of all was writing Arabic characters, and in this
I soon surpassed my masters, and gained a reputation in this branch of
knowledge that reached as far as India itself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the Sultan of the
Indies, curious to see a young prince with such strange tastes, sent an
ambassador to my father, laden with rich presents, and a warm invitation to
visit his court. My father, who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of
so powerful a monarch, and held besides that a little travel would greatly
improve my manners and open my mind, accepted gladly, and in a short time I had
set out for India with the ambassador, attended only by a small suite on
account of the length of the journey, and the badness of the roads. However, as
was my duty, I took with me ten camels, laden with rich presents for the
Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>We had been travelling
for about a month, when one day we saw a cloud of dust moving swiftly towards
us; and as soon as it came near, we found that the dust concealed a band of
fifty robbers. Our men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered by
the camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to overawe them by
informing them who we were, and whither we were going. The robbers, however,
only laughed, and declared that was none of their business, and, without more
words, attacked us brutally. I defended myself to the last, wounded though I
was, but at length, seeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the
ambassador and all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horse
and rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead from a wound in
his side. I managed to jump off without any injury, and looked about to see if
I was pursued. But for the moment I was safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers
were all engaged in quarrelling over their booty. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I found myself in a
country that was quite new to me, and dared not return to the main road lest I
should again fall into the hands of the robbers. Luckily my wound was only a
slight one, and after binding it up as well as I could, I walked on for the
rest of the day, till I reached a cave at the foot of a mountain, where I
passed the night in peace, making my supper off some fruits I had gathered on
the way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I wandered about for a
whole month without knowing where I was going, till at length I found myself on
the outskirts of a beautiful city, watered by winding streams, which enjoyed an
eternal spring. My delight at the prospect of mixing once more with human
beings was somewhat damped at the thought of the miserable object I must seem.
My face and hands had been burned nearly black; my clothes were all in rags,
and my shoes were in such a state that I had been forced to abandon them altogether.

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I entered the town, and
stopped at a tailor's shop to inquire where I was. The man saw I was better
than my condition, and begged me to sit down, and in return I told him my whole
story. The tailor listened with attention, but his reply, instead of giving me
consolation, only increased my trouble. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Beware,&quot; he
said, &quot;of telling any one what you have told me, for the prince who
governs the kingdom is your father's greatest enemy, and he will be rejoiced to
find you in his power.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I thanked the tailor for
his counsel, and said I would do whatever he advised; then, being very hungry,
I gladly ate of the food he put before me, and accepted his offer of a lodging
in his house. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In a few days I had
quite recovered from the hardships I had undergone, and then the tailor,
knowing that it was the custom for the princes of our religion to learn a trade
or profession so as to provide for themselves in times of ill-fortune, inquired
if there was anything I could do for my living. I replied that I had been educated
as a grammarian and a poet, but that my great gift was writing. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;All that is of no
use here,&quot; said the tailor. &quot;Take my advice, put on a short coat, and
as you seem hardy and strong, go into the woods and cut firewood, which you
will sell in the streets. By this means you will earn your living, and be able
to wait till better times come. The hatchet and the cord shall be my
present.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This counsel was very
distasteful to me, but I thought I could not do otherwise than adopt it. So the
next morning I set out with a company of poor wood-cutters, to whom the tailor
had introduced me. Even on the first day I cut enough wood to sell for a
tolerable sum, and very soon I became more expert, and had made enough money to
repay the tailor all he had lent me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had been a wood-cutter
for more than a year, when one day I wandered further into the forest than I
had ever done before, and reached a delicious green glade, where I began to cut
wood. I was hacking at the root of a tree, when I beheld an iron ring fastened
to a trapdoor of the same metal. I soon cleared away the earth, and pulling up
the door, found a staircase, which I hastily made up my mind to go down,
carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection. When I reached the bottom I
discovered that I was in a huge palace, as brilliantly lighted as any palace
above ground that I had ever seen, with a long gallery supported by pillars of
jasper, ornamented with capitals of gold. Down this gallery a lady came to meet
me, of such beauty that I forgot everything else, and thought only of her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To save her all the
trouble possible, I hastened towards her, and bowed low. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who are you? Who
are you?&quot; she said. &quot;A man or a genius?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A man,
madam,&quot; I replied; &quot;I have nothing to do with genii.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;By what accident
do you come here?&quot; she asked again with a sigh. &quot;I have been in this
place now for five and twenty years, and you are the first man who has visited
me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Emboldened by her beauty
and gentleness, I ventured to reply, &quot;Before, madam, I answer your
question, allow me to say how grateful I am for this meeting, which is not only
a consolation to me in my own heavy sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render
your lot happier,&quot; and then I told her who I was, and how I had come
there. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas,
prince,&quot; she said, with a deeper sigh than before, &quot;you have guessed
rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in this gorgeous place. I am the
daughter of the king of the Ebony Isle, of whose fame you surely must have
heard. At my father's desire I was married to a prince who was my own cousin;
but on my very wedding day, I was snatched up by a genius, and brought here in
a faint. For a long while I did nothing but weep, and would not suffer the
genius to come near me; but time teaches us submission, and I have now got accustomed
to his presence, and if clothes and jewels could content me, I have them in
plenty. Every tenth day, for five and twenty years, I have received a visit
from him, but in case I should need his help at any other time, I have only to
touch a talisman that stands at the entrance of my chamber. It wants still five
days to his next visit, and I hope that during that time you will do me the
honour to be my guest.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was too much dazzled
by her beauty to dream of refusing her offer, and accordingly the princess had
me conducted to the bath, and a rich dress befitting my rank was provided for
me. Then a feast of the most delicate dishes was served in a room hung with
embroidered Indian fabrics. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next day, when we were
at dinner, I could maintain my patience no longer, and implored the princess to
break her bonds, and return with me to the world which was lighted by the sun. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What you ask is
impossible,&quot; she answered; &quot;but stay here with me instead, and we can
be happy, and all you will have to do is to betake yourself to the forest every
tenth day, when I am expecting my master the genius. He is very jealous, as you
know, and will not suffer a man to come near me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Princess,&quot; I
replied, &quot;I see it is only fear of the genius that makes you act like
this. For myself, I dread him so little that I mean to break his talisman in
pieces! Awful though you think him, he shall feel the weight of my arm, and I
herewith take a solemn vow to stamp out the whole race.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess, who
realized the consequences of such audacity, entreated me not to touch the
talisman. &quot;If you do, it will be the ruin of both of us,&quot; said she;
&quot;I know genii much better than you.&quot; But the wine I had drunk had
confused my brain; I gave one kick to the talisman, and it fell into a thousand
pieces. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hardly had my foot
touched the talisman when the air became as dark as night, a fearful noise was
heard, and the palace shook to its very foundations. In an instant I was
sobered, and understood what I had done. &quot;Princess!&quot; I cried,
&quot;what is happening?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot; she
exclaimed, forgetting all her own terrors in anxiety for me, &quot;fly, or you
are lost.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I followed her advice
and dashed up the staircase, leaving my hatchet behind me. But I was too late.
The palace opened and the genius appeared, who, turning angrily to the
princess, asked indignantly, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What is the
matter, that you have sent for me like this?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A pain in my
heart,&quot; she replied hastily, &quot;obliged me to seek the aid of this
little bottle. Feeling faint, I slipped and fell against the talisman, which
broke. That is really all.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are an
impudent liar!&quot; cried the genius. &quot;How did this hatchet and those
shoes get here?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I never saw them
before,&quot; she answered, &quot;and you came in such a hurry that you may
have picked them up on the road without knowing it.&quot; To this the genius
only replied by insults and blows. I could hear the shrieks and groans of the
princess, and having by this time taken off my rich garments and put on those
in which I had arrived the previous day, I lifted the trap, found myself once
more in the forest, and returned to my friend the tailor, with a light load of
wood and a heart full of shame and sorrow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The tailor, who had been
uneasy at my long absence, was, delighted to see me; but I kept silence about
my adventure, and as soon as possible retired to my room to lament in secret
over my folly. While I was thus indulging my grief my host entered, and said,
&quot;There is an old man downstairs who has brought your hatchet and slippers,
which he picked up on the road, and now restores to you, as he found out from
one of your comrades where you lived. You had better come down and speak to him
yourself.&quot; At this speech I changed colour, and my legs trembled under me.
The tailor noticed my confusion, and was just going to inquire the reason when
the door of the room opened, and the old man appeared, carrying with him my
hatchet and shoes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am a
genius,&quot; he said, &quot;the son of the daughter of Eblis, prince of the
genii. Is not this hatchet yours, and these shoes?&quot; Without waiting for an
answer--which, indeed, I could hardly have given him, so great was my
fright--he seized hold of me, and darted up into the air with the quickness of
lightning, and then, with equal swiftness, dropped down towards the earth. When
he touched the ground, he rapped it with his foot; it opened, and we found
ourselves in the enchanted palace, in the presence of the beautiful princess of
the Ebony Isle. But how different she looked from what she was when I had last
seen her, for she was lying stretched on the ground covered with blood, and
weeping bitterly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Traitress!&quot;
cried the genius, &quot;is not this man your lover?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She lifted up her eyes
slowly, and looked sadly at me. &quot;I never saw him before,&quot; she
answered slowly. &quot;I do not know who he is.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What!&quot;
exclaimed the genius, &quot;you owe all your sufferings to him, and yet you
dare to say he is a stranger to you!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But if he really
is a stranger to me,&quot; she replied, &quot;why should I tell a lie and cause
his death?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Very well,&quot;
said the genius, drawing his sword, &quot;take this, and cut off his
head.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas,&quot;
answered the princess, &quot;I am too weak even to hold the sabre. And
supposing that I had the strength, why should I put an innocent man to
death?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You condemn
yourself by your refusal,&quot; said the genius; then turning to me, he added,
&quot;and you, do you not know her?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How should
I?&quot; I replied, resolved to imitate the princess in her fidelity. &quot;How
should I, when I never saw her before?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Cut her head
off,&quot; then, &quot;if she is a stranger to you, and I shall believe you are
speaking the truth, and will set you at liberty.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Certainly,&quot; I
answered, taking the sabre in my hands, and making a sign to the princess to
fear nothing, as it was my own life that I was about to sacrifice, and not
hers. But the look of gratitude she gave me shook my courage, and I flung the
sabre to the earth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I should not
deserve to live,&quot; I said to the genius, &quot;if I were such a coward as
to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me, but who is at this moment half
dead herself. Do with me as you will--I am in your power--but I refuse to obey
your cruel command.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I see,&quot; said
the genius, &quot;that you have both made up your minds to brave me, but I will
give you a sample of what you may expect.&quot; So saying, with one sweep of
his sabre he cut off a hand of the princess, who was just able to lift the
other to wave me an eternal farewell. Then I lost consciousness for several
minutes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I came to myself I
implored the genius to keep me no longer in this state of suspense, but to lose
no time in putting an end to my sufferings. The genius, however, paid no
attention to my prayers, but said sternly, &quot;That is the way in which a
genius treats the woman who has betrayed him. If I chose, I could kill you
also; but I will be merciful, and content myself with changing you into a dog,
an ass, a lion, or a bird--whichever you prefer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I caught eagerly at
these words, as giving me a faint hope of softening his wrath. &quot;O
genius!&quot; I cried, &quot;as you wish to spare my life, be generous, and
spare it altogether. Grant my prayer, and pardon my crime, as the best man in
the whole world forgave his neighbour who was eaten up with envy of him.&quot;
Contrary to my hopes, the genius seemed interested in my words, and said he
would like to hear the story of the two neighbours; and as I think, madam, it
may please you, I will tell it to you also. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Envious Man and of
Him Who Was Envied</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In a town of moderate
size, two men lived in neighbouring houses; but they had not been there very
long before one man took such a hatred of the other, and envied him so
bitterly, that the poor man determined to find another home, hoping that when
they no longer met every day his enemy would forget all about him. So he sold
his house and the little furniture it contained, and moved into the capital of
the country, which was luckily at no great distance. About half a mile from
this city he bought a nice little place, with a large garden and a fair-sized
court, in the centre of which stood an old well. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In order to live a
quieter life, the good man put on the robe of a dervish, and divided his house
into a quantity of small cells, where he soon established a number of other
dervishes. The fame of his virtue gradually spread abroad, and many people,
including several of the highest quality, came to visit him and ask his
prayers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Of course it was not
long before his reputation reached the ears of the man who envied him, and this
wicked wretch resolved never to rest till he had in some way worked ill to the
dervish whom he hated. So he left his house and his business to look after
themselves, and betook himself to the new dervish monastery, where he was
welcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable. The excuse he gave for
his appearance was that he had come to consult the chief of the dervishes on a
private matter of great importance. &quot;What I have to say must not be
overheard,&quot; he whispered; &quot;command, I beg of you, that your dervishes
retire into their cells, as night is approaching, and meet me in the
court.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervish did as he
was asked without delay, and directly they were alone together the envious man
began to tell a long story, edging, as they walked to and fro, always nearer to
the well, and when they were quite close, he seized the dervish and dropped him
in. He then ran off triumphantly, without having been seen by anyone, and
congratulating himself that the object of his hatred was dead, and would
trouble him no more. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But in this he was
mistaken! The old well had long been inhabited (unknown to mere human beings)
by a set of fairies and genii, who caught the dervish as he fell, so that he
received no hurt. The dervish himself could see nothing, but he took for
granted that something strange had happened, or he must certainly have been
dashed against the side of the well and been killed. He lay quite still, and in
a moment he heard a voice saying, &quot;Can you guess whom this man is that we
have saved from death?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No,&quot; replied
several other voices. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And the first speaker
answered, &quot;I will tell you. This man, from pure goodness of heart, forsook
the town where he lived and came to dwell here, in the hope of curing one of
his neighbours of the envy he felt towards him. But his character soon won him
the esteem of all, and the envious man's hatred grew, till he came here with
the deliberate intention of causing his death. And this he would have done,
without our help, the very day before the Sultan has arranged to visit this
holy dervish, and to entreat his prayers for the princess, his daughter.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But what is the
matter with the princess that she needs the dervish's prayers?&quot; asked
another voice. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;She has fallen
into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of Dimdim,&quot; replied the
first voice. &quot;But it would be quite simple for this holy chief of the
dervishes to cure her if he only knew! In his convent there is a black cat
which has a tiny white tip to its tail. Now to cure the princess the dervish
must pull out seven of these white hairs, burn three, and with their smoke
perfume the head of the princess. This will deliver her so completely that
Maimoum, the son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her again.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fairies and genii
ceased talking, but the dervish did not forget a word of all they had said; and
when morning came he perceived a place in the side of the well which was broken,
and where he could easily climb out. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervishes, who could
not imagine what had become of him, were enchanted at his reappearance. He told
them of the attempt on his life made by his guest of the previous day, and then
retired into his cell. He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the
voice had spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master. He took
him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull seven white hairs out of his
tail, and put them on one side till they were needed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sun had not long
risen before the Sultan, who was anxious to leave nothing undone that might
deliver the princess, arrived with a large suite at the gate of the monastery,
and was received by the dervishes with profound respect. The Sultan lost no
time in declaring the object of his visit, and leading the chief of the
dervishes aside, he said to him, &quot;Noble scheik, you have guessed perhaps
what I have come to ask you?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, sire,&quot;
answered the dervish; &quot;if I am not mistaken, it is the illness of the
princess which has procured me this honour.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are
right,&quot; returned the Sultan, &quot;and you will give me fresh life if you
can by your prayers deliver my daughter from the strange malady that has taken
possession of her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let your highness
command her to come here, and I will see what I can do.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan, full of
hope, sent orders at once that the princess was to set out as soon as possible,
accompanied by her usual staff of attendants. When she arrived, she was so
thickly veiled that the dervish could not see her face, but he desired a
brazier to be held over her head, and laid the seven hairs on the burning
coals. The instant they were consumed, terrific cries were heard, but no one
could tell from whom they proceeded. Only the dervish guessed that they were
uttered by Maimoum the son of Dimdim, who felt the princess escaping him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All this time she had
seemed unconscious of what she was doing, but now she raised her hand to her
veil and uncovered her face. &quot;Where am I?&quot; she said in a bewildered manner;
&quot;and how did I get here?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was so
delighted to hear these words that he not only embraced his daughter, but
kissed the hand of the dervish. Then, turning to his attendants who stood
round, he said to them, &quot;What reward shall I give to the man who has
restored me my daughter?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They all replied with
one accord that he deserved the hand of the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is my own
opinion,&quot; said he, &quot;and from this moment I declare him to be my
son-in-law.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Shortly after these
events, the grand-vizir died, and his post was given to the dervish. But he did
not hold it for long, for the Sultan fell a victim to an attack of illness, and
as he had no sons, the soldiers and priests declared the dervish heir to the
throne, to the great joy of all the people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day, when the
dervish, who had now become Sultan, was making a royal progress with his court,
he perceived the envious man standing in the crowd. He made a sign to one of
his vizirs, and whispered in his ear, &quot;Fetch me that man who is standing out
there, but take great care not to frighten him.&quot; The vizir obeyed, and
when the envious man was brought before the Sultan, the monarch said to him,
&quot;My friend, I am delighted to see you again.&quot; Then turning to an
officer, he added, &quot;Give him a thousand pieces of gold out of my treasury,
and twenty waggon-loads of merchandise out of my private stores, and let an
escort of soldiers accompany him home.&quot; He then took leave of the envious
man, and went on his way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now when I had ended my
story, I proceeded to show the genius how to apply it to himself. &quot;O
genius,&quot; I said, &quot;you see that this Sultan was not content with
merely forgiving the envious man for the attempt on his life; he heaped rewards
and riches upon him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the genius had made
up his mind, and could not be softened. &quot;Do not imagine that you are going
to escape so easily,&quot; he said. &quot;All I can do is to give you bare
life; you will have to learn what happens to people who interfere with
me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he spoke he seized me
violently by the arm; the roof of the palace opened to make way for us, and we
mounted up so high into the air that the earth looked like a little cloud.
Then, as before, he came down with the swiftness of lightning, and we touched
the ground on a mountain top. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he stooped and
gathered a handful of earth, and murmured some words over it, after which he
threw the earth in my face, saying as he did so, &quot;Quit the form of a man,
and assume that of a monkey.&quot; This done, he vanished, and I was in the
likeness of an ape, and in a country I had never seen before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>However there was no use
in stopping where I was, so I came down the mountain and found myself in a flat
plain which was bounded by the sea. I travelled towards it, and was pleased to
see a vessel moored about half a mile from shore. There were no waves, so I
broke off the branch of a tree, and dragging it down to the water's edge, sat
across it, while, using two sticks for oars, I rowed myself towards the ship. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The deck was full of
people, who watched my progress with interest, but when I seized a rope and
swung myself on board, I found that I had only escaped death at the hands of
the genius to perish by those of the sailors, lest I should bring ill-luck to
the vessel and the merchants. &quot;Throw him into the sea!&quot; cried one.
&quot;Knock him on the head with a hammer,&quot; exclaimed another. &quot;Let
me shoot him with an arrow,&quot; said a third; and certainly somebody would
have had his way if I had not flung myself at the captain's feet and grasped
tight hold of his dress. He appeared touched by my action and patted my head,
and declared that he would take me under his protection, and that no one should
do me any harm. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the end of about
fifty days we cast anchor before a large town, and the ship was immediately
surrounded by a multitude of small boats filled with people, who had come
either to meet their friends or from simple curiosity. Among others, one boat
contained several officials, who asked to see the merchants on board, and
informed them that they had been sent by the Sultan in token of welcome, and to
beg them each to write a few lines on a roll of paper. &quot;In order to
explain this strange request,&quot; continued the officers, &quot;it is
necessary that you should know that the grand-vizir, lately dead, was
celebrated for his beautiful handwriting, and the Sultan is anxious to find a
similar talent in his successor. Hitherto the search has been a failure, but
his Highness has not yet given up hope.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One after another the
merchants set down a few lines upon the roll, and when they had all finished, I
came forward, and snatched the paper from the man who held it. At first they
all thought I was going to throw it into the sea, but they were quieted when
they saw I held it with great care, and great was their surprise when I made
signs that I too wished to write something. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let him do it if
he wants to,&quot; said the captain. &quot;If he only makes a mess of the
paper, you may be sure I will punish him for it. But if, as I hope, he really
can write, for he is the cleverest monkey I ever saw, I will adopt him as my son.
The one I lost had not nearly so much sense!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>No more was said, and I
took the pen and wrote the six sorts of writing in use among the Arabs, and
each sort contained an original verse or couplet, in praise of the Sultan. And
not only did my handwriting completely eclipse that of the merchants, but it is
hardly too much to say that none so beautiful had ever before been seen in that
country. When I had ended the officials took the roll and returned to the
Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as the monarch
saw my writing he did not so much as look at the samples of the merchants, but
desired his officials to take the finest and most richly caparisoned horse in
his stables, together with the most magnificent dress they could procure, and
to put it on the person who had written those lines, and bring him to court. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The officials began to
laugh when they heard the Sultan's command, but as soon as they could speak
they said, &quot;Deign, your highness, to excuse our mirth, but those lines
were not written by a man but by a monkey.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A monkey!&quot;
exclaimed the Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, sire,&quot;
answered the officials. &quot;They were written by a monkey in our
presence.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then bring me the
monkey,&quot; he replied, &quot;as fast as you can.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan's officials
returned to the ship and showed the royal order to the captain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He is the
master,&quot; said the good man, and desired that I should be sent for. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then they put on me the
gorgeous robe and rowed me to land, where I was placed on the horse and led to
the palace. Here the Sultan was awaiting me in great state surrounded by his
court. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All the way along the
streets I had been the object of curiosity to a vast crowd, which had filled
every doorway and every window, and it was amidst their shouts and cheers that
I was ushered into the presence of the Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I approached the throne
on which he was seated and made him three low bows, then prostrated myself at
his feet to the surprise of everyone, who could not understand how it was
possible that a monkey should be able to distinguish a Sultan from other
people, and to pay him the respect due to his rank. However, excepting the
usual speech, I omitted none of the common forms attending a royal audience. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When it was over the
Sultan dismissed all the court, keeping with him only the chief of the eunuchs
and a little slave. He then passed into another room and ordered food to be
brought, making signs to me to sit at table with him and eat. I rose from my
seat, kissed the ground, and took my place at the table, eating, as you may
suppose, with care and in moderation. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before the dishes were
removed I made signs that writing materials, which stood in one corner of the
room, should be laid in front of me. I then took a peach and wrote on it some
verses in praise of the Sultan, who was speechless with astonishment; but when
I did the same thing on a glass from which I had drunk he murmured to himself,
&quot;Why, a man who could do as much would be cleverer than any other man, and
this is only a monkey!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Supper being over
chessmen were brought, and the Sultan signed to me to know if I would play with
him. I kissed the ground and laid my hand on my head to show that I was ready
to show myself worthy of the honour. He beat me the first game, but I won the
second and third, and seeing that this did not quite please I dashed off a verse
by way of consolation. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was so
enchanted with all the talents of which I had given proof that he wished me to
exhibit some of them to other people. So turning to the chief of the eunuchs he
said, &quot;Go and beg my daughter, Queen of Beauty, to come here. I will show
her something she has never seen before.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The chief of the eunuchs
bowed and left the room, ushering in a few moments later the princess, Queen of
Beauty. Her face was uncovered, but the moment she set foot in the room she
threw her veil over her head. &quot;Sire,&quot; she said to her father,
&quot;what can you be thinking of to summon me like this into the presence of a
man?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I do not
understand you,&quot; replied the Sultan. &quot;There is nobody here but the
eunuch, who is your own servant, the little slave, and myself, yet you cover
yourself with your veil and reproach me for having sent for you, as if I had
committed a crime.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
answered the princess, &quot;I am right and you are wrong. This monkey is
really no monkey at all, but a young prince who has been turned into a monkey
by the wicked spells of a genius, son of the daughter of Eblis.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As will be imagined,
these words took the Sultan by surprise, and he looked at me to see how I
should take the statement of the princess. As I was unable to speak, I placed
my hand on my head to show that it was true. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But how do you
know this, my daughter?&quot; asked he. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
replied Queen of Beauty, &quot;the old lady who took care of me in my childhood
was an accomplished magician, and she taught me seventy rules of her art, by
means of which I could, in the twinkling of an eye, transplant your capital
into the middle of the ocean. Her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first
sight all persons who are enchanted, and tells me by whom the spell was
wrought.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My daughter,&quot;
said the Sultan, &quot;I really had no idea you were so clever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
replied the princess, &quot;there are many out-of-the-way things it is as well
to know, but one should never boast of them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well,&quot; asked
the Sultan, &quot;can you tell me what must be done to disenchant the young
prince?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Certainly; and I
can do it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then restore him
to his former shape,&quot; cried the Sultan. &quot;You could give me no greater
pleasure, for I wish to make him my grand-vizir, and to give him to you for
your husband.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;As your Highness
pleases,&quot; replied the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Queen of Beauty rose and
went to her chamber, from which she fetched a knife with some Hebrew words
engraven on the blade. She then desired the Sultan, the chief of the eunuchs,
the little slave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace, and
placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round, she herself standing in the
centre of the court. Here she traced a large circle and in it wrote several
words in Arab characters. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the circle and the
writing were finished she stood in the middle of it and repeated some verses
from the Koran. Slowly the air grew dark, and we felt as if the earth was about
to crumble away, and our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the
genius, son of the daughter of Eblis, suddenly appear under the form of a
colossal lion. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Dog,&quot; cried
the princess when she first caught sight of him, &quot;you think to strike
terror into me by daring to present yourself before me in this hideous
shape.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And you,&quot;
retorted the lion, &quot;have not feared to break our treaty that engaged
solemnly we should never interfere with each other.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Accursed
genius!&quot; exclaimed the princess, &quot;it is you by whom that treaty was
first broken.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will teach you
how to give me so much trouble,&quot; said the lion, and opening his huge mouth
he advanced to swallow her. But the princess expected something of the sort and
was on her guard. She bounded on one side, and seizing one of the hairs of his
mane repeated two or three words over it. In an instant it became a sword, and
with a sharp blow she cut the lion's body into two pieces. These pieces
vanished no one knew where, and only the lion's head remained, which was at
once changed into a scorpion. Quick as thought the princess assumed the form of
a serpent and gave battle to the scorpion, who, finding he was getting the
worst of it, turned himself into an eagle and took flight. But in a moment the
serpent had become an eagle more powerful still, who soared up in the air and
after him, and then we lost sight of them both. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>We all remained where we
were quaking with anxiety, when the ground opened in front of us and a black
and white cat leapt out, its hair standing on end, and miauing frightfully. At
its heels was a wolf, who had almost seized it, when the cat changed itself
into a worm, and, piercing the skin of a pomegranate which had tumbled from a
tree, hid itself in the fruit. The pomegranate swelled till it grew as large as
a pumpkin, and raised itself on to the roof of the gallery, from which it fell
into the court and was broken into bits. While this was taking place the wolf,
who had transformed himself into a cock, began to swallow the seed of the
pomegranate as fast as he could. When all were gone he flew towards us,
flapping his wings as if to ask if we saw any more, when suddenly his eye fell
on one which lay on the bank of the little canal that flowed through the court;
he hastened towards it, but before he could touch it the seed rolled into the
canal and became a fish. The cock flung himself in after the fish and took the
shape of a pike, and for two hours they chased each other up and down under the
water, uttering horrible cries, but we could see nothing. At length they rose
from the water in their proper forms, but darting such flames of fire from their
mouths that we dreaded lest the palace should catch fire. Soon, however, we had
much greater cause for alarm, as the genius, having shaken off the princess,
flew towards us. Our fate would have been sealed if the princess, seeing our
danger, had not attracted the attention of the genius to herself. As it was,
the Sultan's beard was singed and his face scorched, the chief of the eunuchs
was burned to a cinder, while a spark deprived me of the sight of one eye. Both
I and the Sultan had given up all hope of a rescue, when there was a shout of
&quot;Victory, victory!&quot; from the princess, and the genius lay at her feet
a great heap of ashes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Exhausted though she
was, the princess at once ordered the little slave, who alone was uninjured, to
bring her a cup of water, which she took in her hand. First repeating some
magic words over it, she dashed it into my face saying, &quot;If you are only a
monkey by enchantment, resume the form of the man you were before.&quot; In an
instant I stood before her the same man I had formerly been, though having lost
the sight of one eye. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was about to fall on
my knees and thank the princess but she did not give me time. Turning to the
Sultan, her father, she said, &quot;Sire, I have gained the battle, but it has
cost me dear. The fire has penetrated to my heart, and I have only a few
moments to live. This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last
pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest. It was the last struggle of the
genius, and up to that time I was quite safe. But having let this chance slip I
was forced to resort to fire, and in spite of all his experience I showed the
genius that I knew more than he did. He is dead and in ashes, but my own death
is approaching fast.&quot; &quot;My daughter,&quot; cried the Sultan, &quot;how
sad is my condition! I am only surprised I am alive at all! The eunuch is
consumed by the flames, and the prince whom you have delivered has lost the
sight of one eye.&quot; He could say no more, for sobs choked his voice, and we
all wept together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Suddenly the princess
shrieked, &quot;I burn, I burn!&quot; and death came to free her from her
torments. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I have no words, madam,
to tell you of my feelings at this terrible sight. I would rather have remained
a monkey all my life than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner.
As for the Sultan, he was quite inconsolable, and his subjects, who had dearly
loved the princess, shared his grief. For seven days the whole nation mourned,
and then the ashes of the princess were buried with great pomp, and a superb
tomb was raised over her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as the Sultan
recovered from the severe illness which had seized him after the death of the
princess he sent for me and plainly, though politely, informed me that my
presence would always remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would
instantly quit his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it. I was, of
course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of me I shaved my
beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender. After wandering
aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to come to Bagdad and request
an audience of the Commander of the Faithful. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And that, madam, is my
story. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The other Calender then
told his story. </span></p>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My story, said the Third
Calender, is quite different from those of my two friends. It was fate that
deprived them of the sight of their right eyes, but mine was lost by my own
folly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My name is Agib, and I
am the son of a king called Cassib, who reigned over a large kingdom, which had

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I succeeded to my
father's throne my first care was to visit the provinces on the mainland, and
then to sail to the numerous islands which lay off the shore, in order to gain
the hearts of my subjects. These voyages gave me such a taste for sailing that
I soon determined to explore more distant seas, and commanded a fleet of large
ships to be got ready without delay. When they were properly fitted out I
embarked on my expedition. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For forty days wind and
weather were all in our favour, but the next night a terrific storm arose,
which blew us hither and thither for ten days, till the pilot confessed that he
had quite lost his bearings. Accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead
to try to catch a sight of land, and reported that nothing was to be seen but
the sea and sky, except a huge mass of blackness that lay astern. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On hearing this the
pilot grew white, and, beating his breast, he cried, &quot;Oh, sir, we are
lost, lost!&quot; till the ship's crew trembled at they knew not what. When he
had recovered himself a little, and was able to explain the cause of his
terror, he replied, in answer to my question, that we had drifted far out of
our course, and that the following day about noon we should come near that mass
of darkness, which, said he, is nothing but the famous Black Mountain. This
mountain is composed of adamant, which attracts to itself all the iron and
nails in your ship; and as we are helplessly drawn nearer, the force of
attraction will become so great that the iron and nails will fall out of the
ships and cling to the mountain, and the ships will sink to the bottom with all
that are in them. This it is that causes the side of the mountain towards the
sea to appear of such a dense blackness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As may be supposed--continued
the pilot--the mountain sides are very rugged, but on the summit stands a brass
dome supported on pillars, and bearing on top the figure of a brass horse, with
a rider on his back. This rider wears a breastplate of lead, on which strange signs
and figures are engraved, and it is said that as long as this statue remains on
the dome, vessels will never cease to perish at the foot of the mountain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying, the pilot
began to weep afresh, and the crew, fearing their last hour had come, made their
wills, each one in favour of his fellow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At noon next day, as the
pilot had foretold, we were so near to the Black Mountain that we saw all the
nails and iron fly out of the ships and dash themselves against the mountain
with a horrible noise. A moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank, the
crews with them. I alone managed to grasp a floating plank, and was driven
ashore by the wind, without even a scratch. What was my joy on finding myself
at the bottom of some steps which led straight up the mountain, for there was
not another inch to the right or the left where a man could set his foot. And,
indeed, even the steps themselves were so narrow and so steep that, if the
lightest breeze had arisen, I should certainly have been blown into the sea. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I reached the top I
found the brass dome and the statue exactly as the pilot had described, but was
too wearied with all I had gone through to do more than glance at them, and,
flinging myself under the dome, was asleep in an instant. In my dreams an old
man appeared to me and said, &quot;Hearken, Agib! As soon as thou art awake dig
up the ground underfoot, and thou shalt find a bow of brass and three arrows of
lead. Shoot the arrows at the statue, and the rider shall tumble into the sea,
but the horse will fall down by thy side, and thou shalt bury him in the place
from which thou tookest the bow and arrows. This being done the sea will rise
and cover the mountain, and on it thou wilt perceive the figure of a metal man
seated in a boat, having an oar in each hand. Step on board and let him conduct
thee; but if thou wouldest behold thy kingdom again, see that thou takest not
the name of Allah into thy mouth.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having uttered these
words the vision left me, and I woke, much comforted. I sprang up and drew the bow
and arrows out of the ground, and with the third shot the horseman fell with a
great crash into the sea, which instantly began to rise, so rapidly, that I had
hardly time to bury the horse before the boat approached me. I stepped silently
in and sat down, and the metal man pushed off, and rowed without stopping for
nine days, after which land appeared on the horizon. I was so overcome with joy
at this sight that I forgot all the old man had told me, and cried out,
&quot;Allah be praised! Allah be praised!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The words were scarcely
out of my mouth when the boat and man sank from beneath me, and left me
floating on the surface. All that day and the next night I swam and floated
alternately, making as well as I could for the land which was nearest to me. At
last my strength began to fail, and I gave myself up for lost, when the wind
suddenly rose, and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore. Then, placing myself in
safety, I hastily spread my clothes out to dry in the sun, and flung myself on
the warm ground to rest. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next morning I dressed
myself and began to look about me. There seemed to be no one but myself on the
island, which was covered with fruit trees and watered with streams, but seemed
a long distance from the mainland which I hoped to reach. Before, however, I
had time to feel cast down, I saw a ship making directly for the island, and
not knowing whether it would contain friends or foes, I hid myself in the thick
branches of a tree. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sailors ran the ship
into a creek, where ten slaves landed, carrying spades and pickaxes. In the
middle of the island they stopped, and after digging some time, lifted up what
seemed to be a trapdoor. They then returned to the vessel two or three times
for furniture and provisions, and finally were accompanied by an old man,
leading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age. They all
disappeared down the trapdoor, and after remaining below for a few minutes came
up again, but without the boy, and let down the trapdoor, covering it with
earth as before. This done, they entered the ship and set sail. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as they were out
of sight, I came down from my tree, and went to the place where the boy had
been buried. I dug up the earth till I reached a large stone with a ring in the
centre. This, when removed, disclosed a flight of stone steps which led to a
large room richly furnished and lighted by tapers. On a pile of cushions,
covered with tapestry, sat the boy. He looked up, startled and frightened at
the sight of a stranger in such a place, and to soothe his fears, I at once
spoke: &quot;Be not alarmed, sir, whoever you may be. I am a king, and the son
of a king, and will do you no hurt. On the contrary, perhaps I have been sent
here to deliver you out of this tomb, where you have been buried alive.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hearing my words, the young
man recovered himself, and when I had ended, he said, &quot;The reasons,
Prince, that have caused me to be buried in this place are so strange that they
cannot but surprise you. My father is a rich merchant, owning much land and
many ships, and has great dealings in precious stones, but he never ceased
mourning that he had no child to inherit his wealth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;At length one day
he dreamed that the following year a son would be born to him, and when this
actually happened, he consulted all the wise men in the kingdom as to the
future of the infant. One and all they said the same thing. I was to live
happily till I was fifteen, when a terrible danger awaited me, which I should
hardly escape. If, however, I should succeed in doing so, I should live to a
great old age. And, they added, when the statue of the brass horse on the top
of the mountain of adamant is thrown into the sea by Agib, the son of Cassib,
then beware, for fifty days later your son shall fall by his hand! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This prophecy
struck the heart of my father with such woe, that he never got over it, but
that did not prevent him from attending carefully to my education till I
attained, a short time ago, my fifteenth birthday. It was only yesterday that
the news reached him that ten days previously the statue of brass had been
thrown into the sea, and he at once set about hiding me in this underground
chamber, which was built for the purpose, promising to fetch me out when the
forty days have passed. For myself, I have no fears, as Prince Agib is not
likely to come here to look for me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I listened to his story
with an inward laugh as to the absurdity of my ever wishing to cause the death
of this harmless boy, whom I hastened to assure of my friendship and even of my
protection; begging him, in return, to convey me in his father's ship to my own
country. I need hardly say that I took special care not to inform him that I
was the Agib whom he dreaded. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The day passed in
conversation on various subjects, and I found him a youth of ready wit and of
some learning. I took on myself the duties of a servant, held the basin and
water for him when he washed, prepared the dinner and set it on the table. He
soon grew to love me, and for thirty-nine days we spent as pleasant an
existence as could be expected underground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The morning of the
fortieth dawned, and the young man when he woke gave thanks in an outburst of
joy that the danger was passed. &quot;My father may be here at any
moment,&quot; said he, &quot;so make me, I pray you, a bath of hot water, that
I may bathe, and change my clothes, and be ready to receive him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So I fetched the water
as he asked, and washed and rubbed him, after which he lay down again and slept
a little. When he opened his eyes for the second time, he begged me to bring
him a melon and some sugar, that he might eat and refresh himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I soon chose a fine
melon out of those which remained, but could find no knife to cut it with.
&quot;Look in the cornice over my head,&quot; said he, &quot;and I think you
will see one.&quot; It was so high above me, that I had some difficulty in reaching
it, and catching my foot in the covering of the bed, I slipped, and fell right
upon the young man, the knife going straight into his heart. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this awful sight I
shrieked aloud in my grief and pain. I threw myself on the ground and rent my
clothes and tore my hair with sorrow. Then, fearing to be punished as his
murderer by the unhappy father, I raised the great stone which blocked the
staircase, and quitting the underground chamber, made everything fast as
before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarcely had I finished
when, looking out to sea, I saw the vessel heading for the island, and, feeling
that it would be useless for me to protest my innocence, I again concealed
myself among the branches of a tree that grew near by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old man and his
slaves pushed off in a boat directly the ship touched land, and walked quickly
towards the entrance to the underground chamber; but when they were near enough
to see that the earth had been disturbed, they paused and changed colour. In
silence they all went down and called to the youth by name; then for a moment I
heard no more. Suddenly a fearful scream rent the air, and the next instant the
slaves came up the steps, carrying with them the body of the old man, who had
fainted from sorrow! Laying him down at the foot of the tree in which I had
taken shelter, they did their best to recover him, but it took a long while.
When at last he revived, they left him to dig a grave, and then laying the
young man's body in it, they threw in the earth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This ended, the slaves
brought up all the furniture that remained below, and put it on the vessel, and
breaking some boughs to weave a litter, they laid the old man on it, and
carried him to the ship, which spread its sails and stood out to sea. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So once more I was quite
alone, and for a whole month I walked daily over the island, seeking for some
chance of escape. At length one day it struck me that my prison had grown much
larger, and that the mainland seemed to be nearer. My heart beat at this
thought, which was almost too good to be true. I watched a little longer: there
was no doubt about it, and soon there was only a tiny stream for me to cross. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Even when I was safe on
the other side I had a long distance to go on the mud and sand before I reached
dry ground, and very tired I was, when far in front of me I caught sight of a
castle of red copper, which, at first sight, I took to be a fire. I made all
the haste I could, and after some miles of hard walking stood before it, and
gazed at it in astonishment, for it seemed to me the most wonderful building I
had ever beheld. While I was still staring at it, there came towards me a tall
old man, accompanied by ten young men, all handsome, and all blind of the right
eye. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now in its way, the
spectacle of ten men walking together, all blind of the right eye, is as
uncommon as that of a copper castle, and I was turning over in my mind what
could be the meaning of this strange fact, when they greeted me warmly, and
inquired what had brought me there. I replied that my story was somewhat long,
but that if they would take the trouble to sit down, I should be happy to tell
it them. When I had finished, the young men begged that I would go with them to
the castle, and I joyfully accepted their offer. We passed through what seemed
to me an endless number of rooms, and came at length into a large hall,
furnished with ten small blue sofas for the ten young men, which served as beds
as well as chairs, and with another sofa in the middle for the old man. As none
of the sofas could hold more than one person, they bade me place myself on the
carpet, and to ask no questions about anything I should see. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a little while the
old man rose and brought in supper, which I ate heartily, for I was very
hungry. Then one of the young men begged me to repeat my story, which had struck
them all with astonishment, and when I had ended, the old man was bidden to
&quot;do his duty,&quot; as it was late, and they wished to go to bed. At these
words he rose, and went to a closet, from which he brought out ten basins, all
covered with blue stuff. He set one before each of the young men, together with
a lighted taper. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the covers were
taken off the basins, I saw they were filled with ashes, coal-dust, and
lamp-black. The young men mixed these all together, and smeared the whole over
their heads and faces. They then wept and beat their breasts, crying,
&quot;This is the fruit of idleness, and of our wicked lives.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This ceremony lasted
nearly the whole night, and when it stopped they washed themselves carefully,
and put on fresh clothes, and lay down to sleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All this while I had
refrained from questions, though my curiosity almost seemed to burn a hole in
me, but the following day, when we went out to walk, I said to them,
&quot;Gentlemen, I must disobey your wishes, for I can keep silence no more.
You do not appear to lack wit, yet you do such actions as none but madmen could
be capable of. Whatever befalls me I cannot forbear asking, `Why you daub your
faces with black, and how it is you are all blind of one eye?'&quot; But they
only answered that such questions were none of my business, and that I should
do well to hold my peace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>During that day we spoke
of other things, but when night came, and the same ceremony was repeated, I
implored them most earnestly to let me know the meaning of it all. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is for your own
sake,&quot; replied one of the young men, &quot;that we have not granted your
request, and to preserve you from our unfortunate fate. If, however, you wish
to share our destiny we will delay no longer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I answered that whatever
might be the consequence I wished to have my curiosity satisfied, and that I
would take the result on my own head. He then assured me that, even when I had
lost my eye, I should be unable to remain with them, as their number was
complete, and could not be added to. But to this I replied that, though I
should be grieved to part company with such honest gentlemen, I would not be
turned from my resolution on that account. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On hearing my
determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and killed it, and handed me a
knife, which they said I should by-and-by find useful. &quot;We must sew you
into this sheep-skin,&quot; said they, &quot;and then leave you. A fowl of
monstrous size, called a roc, will appear in the air, taking you to be a sheep.
He will snatch you up and carry you into the sky, but be not alarmed, for he
will bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain. When you are
on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throw it off. As soon as the roc
sees you he will fly away from fear, but you must walk on till you come to a
castle covered with plates of gold, studded with jewels. Enter boldly at the
gate, which always stands open, but do not ask us to tell you what we saw or
what befel us there, for that you will learn for yourself. This only we may
say, that it cost us each our right eye, and has imposed upon us our nightly
penance.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After the young
gentlemen had been at the trouble of sewing the sheep-skin on me they left me,
and retired to the hall. In a few minutes the roc appeared, and bore me off to
the top of the mountain in his huge claws as lightly as if I had been a
feather, for this great white bird is so strong that he has been known to carry
even an elephant to his nest in the hills. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The moment my feet
touched the ground I took out my knife and cut the threads that bound me, and
the sight of me in my proper clothes so alarmed the roc that he spread his
wings and flew away. Then I set out to seek the castle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I found it after
wandering about for half a day, and never could I have imagined anything so
glorious. The gate led into a square court, into which opened a hundred doors,
ninety-nine of them being of rare woods and one of gold. Through each of these
doors I caught glimpses of splendid gardens or of rich storehouses. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Entering one of the
doors which was standing open I found myself in a vast hall where forty young
ladies, magnificently dressed, and of perfect beauty, were reclining. As soon
as they saw me they rose and uttered words of welcome, and even forced me to
take possession of a seat that was higher than their own, though my proper
place was at their feet. Not content with this, one brought me splendid
garments, while another filled a basin with scented water and poured it over my
hands, and the rest busied themselves with preparing refreshments. After I had
eaten and drunk of the most delicate food and rarest wines, the ladies crowded
round me and begged me to tell them all my adventures. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By the time I had
finished night had fallen, and the ladies lighted up the castle with such a
prodigious quantity of tapers that even day could hardly have been brighter. We
then sat down to a supper of dried fruits and sweetmeats, after which some sang
and others danced. I was so well amused that I did not notice how the time was
passing, but at length one of the ladies approached and informed me it was
midnight, and that, as I must be tired, she would conduct me to the room that
had been prepared for me. Then, bidding me good-night, I was left to sleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I spent the next
thirty-nine days in much the same way as the first, but at the close of that
time the ladies appeared (as was their custom) in my room one morning to
inquire how I had slept, and instead of looking cheerful and smiling they were
in floods of tears. &quot;Prince,&quot; said they, &quot;we must leave you, and
never was it so hard to part from any of our friends. Most likely we shall
never see you again, but if you have sufficient self-command perhaps we may yet
look forward to a meeting.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ladies,&quot; I
replied, &quot;what is the meaning of these strange words--I pray you to tell
me?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Know then,&quot;
answered one of them, &quot;that we are all princesses--each a king's daughter.
We live in this castle together, in the way that you have seen, but at the end
of every year secret duties call us away for the space of forty days. The time
has now come; but before we depart, we will leave you our keys, so that you may
not lack entertainment during our absence. But one thing we would ask of you.
The Golden Door, alone, forbear to open, as you value your own peace, and the
happiness of your life. That door once unlocked, we must bid you farewell for
ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Weeping, I assured them
of my prudence, and after embracing me tenderly, they went their ways. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Every day I opened two
or three fresh doors, each of which contained behind it so many curious things
that I had no chance of feeling dull, much as I regretted the absence of the
ladies. Sometimes it was an orchard, whose fruit far exceeded in bigness any
that grew in my father's garden. Sometimes it was a court planted with roses,
jessamine, dafeodils, hyacinths and anemones, and a thousand other flowers of
which I did not know the names. Or again, it would be an aviary, fitted with
all kinds of singing birds, or a treasury heaped up with precious stones; but
whatever I might see, all was perfect of its own sort. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thirty-nine days passed
away more rapidly than I could have conceived possible, and the following
morning the princesses were to return to the castle. But alas! I had explored
every corner, save only the room that was shut in by the Golden Door, and I had
no longer anything to amuse myself with. I stood before the forbidden place for
some time, gazing at its beauty; then a happy inspiration struck me, that
because I unlocked the door it was not necessary that I should enter the
chamber. It would be enough for me to stand outside and view whatever hidden
wonders might be therein. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus arguing against my
own conscience, I turned the key, when a smell rushed out that, pleasant though
it was, overcame me completely, and I fell fainting across the threshold. Instead
of being warned by this accident, directly I came to myself I went for a few
moments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume, and then entered
boldly. I found myself in a large, vaulted room, lighted by tapers, scented
with aloes and ambergris, standing in golden candle-sticks, whilst gold and
silver lamps hung from the ceiling. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Though objects of rare
workmanship lay heaped around me, I paid them scant attention, so much was I
struck by a great black horse which stood in one corner, the handsomest and
best-shaped animal I had ever seen. His saddle and bridle were of massive gold,
curiously wrought; one side of his trough was filled with clean barley and
sesame, and the other with rose water. I led the animal into the open air, and
then jumped on his back, shaking the reins as I did so, but as he never
stirred, I touched him lightly with a switch I had picked up in his stable. No
sooner did he feel the stroke, than he spread his wings (which I had not
perceived before), and flew up with me straight into the sky. When he had
reached a prodigious height, he next darted back to earth, and alighted on the
terrace belonging to a castle, shaking me violently out of the saddle as he did
so, and giving me such a blow with his tail, that he knocked out my right eye. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Half-stunned as I was
with all that had happened to me, I rose to my feet, thinking as I did so of
what had befallen the ten young men, and watching the horse which was soaring
into the clouds. I left the terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall,
which I knew to have been the one from which the roc had taken me, by the ten
blue sofas against the wall. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The ten young men were
not present when I first entered, but came in soon after, accompanied by the
old man. They greeted me kindly, and bewailed my misfortune, though, indeed,
they had expected nothing less. &quot;All that has happened to you,&quot; they
said, &quot;we also have undergone, and we should be enjoying the same
happiness still, had we not opened the Golden Door while the princesses were absent.
You have been no wiser than we, and have suffered the same punishment. We would
gladly receive you among us, to perform such penance as we do, but we have
already told you that this is impossible. Depart, therefore, from hence and go
to the Court of Bagdad, where you shall meet with him that can decide your
destiny.&quot; They told me the way I was to travel, and I left them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the road I caused my
beard and eyebrows to be shaved, and put on a Calender's habit. I have had a
long journey, but arrived this evening in the city, where I met my brother
Calenders at the gate, being strangers like myself. We wondered much at one
another, to see we were all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisure to
discourse at length of our common calamities. We had only so much time as to
come hither to implore those favours which you have been generously pleased to
grant us. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Seven Voyages of Sindbad the
Sailor</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the times of the
Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdad a poor porter named Hindbad, who
on a very hot day was sent to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to
the other. Before he had accomplished half the distance he was so tired that,
finding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose
water, and a cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden upon the ground, and
sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house. Very soon he decided that he
could not have chosen a pleasanter place; a delicious perfume of aloes wood and
pastilles came from the open windows and mingled with the scent of the rose
water which steamed up from the hot pavement. Within the palace he heard some
music, as of many instruments cunningly played, and the melodious warble of
nightingales and other birds, and by this, and the appetising smell of many
dainty dishes of which he presently became aware, he judged that feasting and merry
making were going on. He wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he
had never seen before, the street in which it stood being one which he seldom
had occasion to pass. To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly
dressed servants who stood at the door, and asked one of them the name of the
master of the mansion. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What,&quot;
replied he, &quot;do you live in Bagdad, and not know that here lives the noble
Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who sailed over every sea upon which
the sun shines?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The porter, who had
often heard people speak of the immense wealth of Sindbad, could not help
feeling envious of one whose lot seemed to be as happy as his own was
miserable. Casting his eyes up to the sky he exclaimed aloud, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Consider, Mighty
Creator of all things, the differences between Sindbad's life and mine. Every
day I suffer a thousand hardships and misfortunes, and have hard work to get
even enough bad barley bread to keep myself and my family alive, while the
lucky Sindbad spends money right and left and lives upon the fat of the land!
What has he done that you should give him this pleasant life--what have I done
to deserve so hard a fate?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying he stamped
upon the ground like one beside himself with misery and despair. Just at this moment
a servant came out of the palace, and taking him by the arm said, &quot;Come
with me, the noble Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hindbad was not a little
surprised at this summons, and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn
upon him the displeasure of Sindbad, so he tried to excuse himself upon the
pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in
the street. However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of,
and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was
obliged to yield. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He followed the servant
into a vast room, where a great company was seated round a table covered with
all sorts of delicacies. In the place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose
long white beard gave him a venerable air. Behind his chair stood a crowd of
attendants eager to minister to his wants. This was the famous Sindbad himself.
The porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence,
tremblingly saluted the noble company. Sindbad, making a sign to him to
approach, caused him to be seated at his right hand, and himself heaped choice
morsels upon his plate, and poured out for him a draught of excellent wine, and
presently, when the banquet drew to a close, spoke to him familiarly, asking
his name and occupation. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot;
replied the porter, &quot;I am called Hindbad.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am glad to see
you here,&quot; continued Sindbad. &quot;And I will answer for the rest of the
company that they are equally pleased, but I wish you to tell me what it was
that you said just now in the street.&quot; For Sindbad, passing by the open
window before the feast began, had heard his complaint and therefore had sent
for him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this question Hindbad
was covered with confusion, and hanging down his head, replied, &quot;My lord, I
confess that, overcome by weariness and ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words,
which I pray you to pardon me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh!&quot; replied
Sindbad, &quot;do not imagine that I am so unjust as to blame you. On the
contrary, I understand your situation and can pity you. Only you appear to be
mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right. You doubtless imagine that I
have acquired all the wealth and luxury that you see me enjoy without
difficulty or danger, but this is far indeed from being the case. I have only
reached this happy state after having for years suffered every possible kind of
toil and danger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my noble
friends,&quot; he continued, addressing the company, &quot;I assure you that my
adventures have been strange enough to deter even the most avaricious men from
seeking wealth by traversing the seas. Since you have, perhaps, heard but
confused accounts of my seven voyages, and the dangers and wonders that I have
met with by sea and land, I will now give you a full and true account of them,
which I think you will be well pleased to hear.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As Sindbad was relating
his adventures chiefly on account of the porter, he ordered, before beginning
his tale, that the burden which had been left in the street should be carried
by some of his own servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at
first, while he remained to listen to the story. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had inherited
considerable wealth from my parents, and being young and foolish I at first
squandered it recklessly upon every kind of pleasure, but presently, finding
that riches speedily take to themselves wings if managed as badly as I was
managing mine, and remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed, I
began to bethink me of how I could make the best of what still remained to me.
I sold all my household goods by public auction, and joined a company of
merchants who traded by sea, embarking with them at Balsora in a ship which we
had fitted out between us. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>We set sail and took our
course towards the East Indies by the Persian Gulf, having the coast of Persia
upon our left hand and upon our right the shores of Arabia Felix. I was at
first much troubled by the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered
my health, and since that hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From time to time we
landed at various islands, where we sold or exchanged our merchandise, and one
day, when the wind dropped suddenly, we found ourselves becalmed close to a
small island like a green meadow, which only rose slightly above the surface of
the water. Our sails were furled, and the captain gave permission to all who
wished to land for a while and amuse themselves. I was among the number, but
when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to
enjoy the repast which we had brought with us, we were startled by a sudden and
violent trembling of the island, while at the same moment those left upon the
ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives, since what we had
taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale. Those who
were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it, others sprang into the sea,
but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of
the ocean, leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to
make our fire. Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that
ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were
in the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I was left at the
mercy of the waves. All that day I floated up and down, now beaten this way,
now that, and when night fell I despaired for my life; but, weary and spent as
I was, I clung to my frail support, and great was my joy when the morning light
showed me that I had drifted against an island. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The cliffs were high and
steep, but luckily for me some tree-roots protruded in places, and by their aid
I climbed up at last, and stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I
lay, more dead than alive, till the sun was high in the heavens. By that time I
was very hungry, but after some searching I came upon some eatable herbs, and a
spring of clear water, and much refreshed I set out to explore the island.
Presently I reached a great plain where a grazing horse was tethered, and as I
stood looking at it I heard voices talking apparently underground, and in a
moment a man appeared who asked me how I came upon the island. I told him my
adventures, and heard in return that he was one of the grooms of Mihrage, the
king of the island, and that each year they came to feed their master's horses
in this plain. He took me to a cave where his companions were assembled, and
when I had eaten of the food they set before me, they bade me think myself
fortunate to have come upon them when I did, since they were going back to their
master on the morrow, and without their aid I could certainly never have found
my way to the inhabited part of the island. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Early the next morning
we accordingly set out, and when we reached the capital I was graciously
received by the king, to whom I related my adventures, upon which he ordered
that I should be well cared for and provided with such things as I needed.
Being a merchant I sought out men of my own profession, and particularly those
who came from foreign countries, as I hoped in this way to hear news from
Bagdad, and find out some means of returning thither, for the capital was
situated upon the sea-shore, and visited by vessels from all parts of the
world. In the meantime I heard many curious things, and answered many questions
concerning my own country, for I talked willingly with all who came to me. Also
to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel,
which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a
spirit named Deggial. Indeed, the sailors assured me that often at night the
playing of timbals could be heard upon it. However, I saw nothing strange upon
my voyage, saving some fish that were full two hundred cubits long, but were
fortunately more in dread of us than even we were of them, and fled from us if
we did but strike upon a board to frighten them. Other fishes there were only a
cubit long which had heads like owls. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day after my return,
as I went down to the quay, I saw a ship which had just cast anchor, and was
discharging her cargo, while the merchants to whom it belonged were busily
directing the removal of it to their warehouses. Drawing nearer I presently
noticed that my own name was marked upon some of the packages, and after having
carefully examined them, I felt sure that they were indeed those which I had
put on board our ship at Balsora. I then recognised the captain of the vessel,
but as I was certain that he believed me to be dead, I went up to him and asked
who owned the packages that I was looking at. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;There was on board
my ship,&quot; he replied, &quot;a merchant of Bagdad named Sindbad. One day he
and several of my other passengers landed upon what we supposed to be an
island, but which was really an enormous whale floating asleep upon the waves.
No sooner did it feel upon its back the heat of the fire which had been
kindled, than it plunged into the depths of the sea. Several of the people who
were upon it perished in the waters, and among others this unlucky Sindbad.
This merchandise is his, but I have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit
of his family if I should ever chance to meet with them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Captain,&quot;
said I, &quot;I am that Sindbad whom you believe to be dead, and these are my
possessions!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the captain heard
these words he cried out in amazement, &quot;Lackaday! and what is the world
coming to? In these days there is not an honest man to be met with. Did I not
with my own eyes see Sindbad drown, and now you have the audacity to tell me
that you are he! I should have taken you to be a just man, and yet for the sake
of obtaining that which does not belong to you, you are ready to invent this
horrible falsehood.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have patience, and
do me the favour to hear my story,&quot; said I. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Speak then,&quot;
replied the captain, &quot;I'm all attention.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So I told him of my
escape and of my fortunate meeting with the king's grooms, and how kindly I had
been received at the palace. Very soon I began to see that I had made some
impression upon him, and after the arrival of some of the other merchants, who
showed great joy at once more seeing me alive, he declared that he also
recognised me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Throwing himself upon my
neck he exclaimed, &quot;Heaven be praised that you have escaped from so great
a danger. As to your goods, I pray you take them, and dispose of them as you
please.&quot; I thanked him, and praised his honesty, begging him to accept
several bales of merchandise in token of my gratitude, but he would take
nothing. Of the choicest of my goods I prepared a present for King Mihrage, who
was at first amazed, having known that I had lost my all. However, when I had
explained to him how my bales had been miraculously restored to me, he
graciously accepted my gifts, and in return gave me many valuable things. I
then took leave of him, and exchanging my merchandise for sandal and aloes
wood, camphor, nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger, I embarked upon the same
vessel and traded so successfully upon our homeward voyage that I arrived in
Balsora with about one hundred thousand sequins. My family received me with as
much joy as I felt upon seeing them once more. I bought land and slaves, and
built a great house in which I resolved to live happily, and in the enjoyment
of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Here Sindbad paused, and
commanded the musicians to play again, while the feasting continued until
evening. When the time came for the porter to depart, Sindbad gave him a purse
containing one hundred sequins, saying, &quot;Take this, Hindbad, and go home,
but to-morrow come again and you shall hear more of my adventures.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The porter retired quite
overcome by so much generosity, and you may imagine that he was well received
at home, where his wife and children thanked their lucky stars that he had
found such a benefactor. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day Hindbad,
dressed in his best, returned to the voyager's house, and was received with
open arms. As soon as all the guests had arrived the banquet began as before,
and when they had feasted long and merrily, Sindbad addressed them thus: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friends, I beg
that you will give me your attention while I relate the adventures of my second
voyage, which you will find even more astonishing than the first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Second Voyage</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had resolved, as you
know, on my return from my first voyage, to spend the rest of my days quietly
in Bagdad, but very soon I grew tired of such an idle life and longed once more
to find myself upon the sea. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I procured, therefore,
such goods as were suitable for the places I intended to visit, and embarked
for the second time in a good ship with other merchants whom I knew to be
honourable men. We went from island to island, often making excellent bargains,
until one day we landed at a spot which, though covered with fruit trees and
abounding in springs of excellent water, appeared to possess neither houses nor
people. While my companions wandered here and there gathering flowers and fruit
I sat down in a shady place, and, having heartily enjoyed the provisions and
the wine I had brought with me, I fell asleep, lulled by the murmur of a clear
brook which flowed close by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>How long I slept I know
not, but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror
that I was alone and that the ship was gone. I rushed to and fro like one
distracted, uttering cries of despair, and when from the shore I saw the vessel
under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon, I wished bitterly enough
that I had been content to stay at home in safety. But since wishes could do me
no good, I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape.
When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances
towards the sea; but, finding nothing hopeful there, I turned landward, and my
curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object, so far off that I could
not make out what it might be. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Descending from the tree
I hastily collected what remained of my provisions and set off as fast as I
could go towards it. As I drew near it seemed to me to be a white ball of
immense size and height, and when I could touch it, I found it marvellously
smooth and soft. As it was impossible to climb it--for it presented no
foot-hold--I walked round about it seeking some opening, but there was none. I
counted, however, that it was at least fifty paces round. By this time the sun
was near setting, but quite suddenly it fell dark, something like a huge black
cloud came swiftly over me, and I saw with amazement that it was a bird of
extraordinary size which was hovering near. Then I remembered that I had often
heard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird called a roc, and it occurred to me
that the white object which had so puzzled me must be its egg. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sure enough the bird
settled slowly down upon it, covering it with its wings to keep it warm, and I
cowered close beside the egg in such a position that one of the bird's feet,
which was as large as the trunk of a tree, was just in front of me. Taking off
my turban I bound myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the
roc, when it took flight next morning, would bear me away with it from the
desolate island. And this was precisely what did happen. As soon as the dawn
appeared the bird rose into the air carrying me up and up till I could no
longer see the earth, and then suddenly it descended so swiftly that I almost
lost consciousness. When I became aware that the roc had settled and that I was
once again upon solid ground, I hastily unbound my turban from its foot and
freed myself, and that not a moment too soon; for the bird, pouncing upon a
huge snake, killed it with a few blows from its powerful beak, and seizing it
up rose into the air once more and soon disappeared from my view. When I had
looked about me I began to doubt if I had gained anything by quitting the
desolate island. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The valley in which I
found myself was deep and narrow, and surrounded by mountains which towered
into the clouds, and were so steep and rocky that there was no way of climbing
up their sides. As I wandered about, seeking anxiously for some means of
escaping from this trap, I observed that the ground was strewed with diamonds,
some of them of an astonishing size. This sight gave me great pleasure, but my
delight was speedily damped when I saw also numbers of horrible snakes so long
and so large that the smallest of them could have swallowed an elephant with
ease. Fortunately for me they seemed to hide in caverns of the rocks by day,
and only came out by night, probably because of their enemy the roc. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All day long I wandered
up and down the valley, and when it grew dusk I crept into a little cave, and
having blocked up the entrance to it with a stone, I ate part of my little store
of food and lay down to sleep, but all through the night the serpents crawled
to and fro, hissing horribly, so that I could scarcely close my eyes for
terror. I was thankful when the morning light appeared, and when I judged by
the silence that the serpents had retreated to their dens I came tremblingly
out of my cave and wandered up and down the valley once more, kicking the
diamonds contemptuously out of my path, for I felt that they were indeed vain
things to a man in my situation. At last, overcome with weariness, I sat down
upon a rock, but I had hardly closed my eyes when I was startled by something
which fell to the ground with a thud close beside me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was a huge piece of
fresh meat, and as I stared at it several more pieces rolled over the cliffs in
different places. I had always thought that the stories the sailors told of the
famous valley of diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants had
devised for getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers' tales
invented to give pleasure to the hearers, but now I perceived that they were
surely true. These merchants came to the valley at the time when the eagles,
which keep their eyries in the rocks, had hatched their young. The merchants
then threw great lumps of meat into the valley. These, falling with so much
force upon the diamonds, were sure to take up some of the precious stones with
them, when the eagles pounced upon the meat and carried it off to their nests
to feed their hungry broods. Then the merchants, scaring away the parent birds
with shouts and outcries, would secure their treasures. Until this moment I had
looked upon the valley as my grave, for I had seen no possibility of getting
out of it alive, but now I took courage and began to devise a means of escape.
I began by picking up all the largest diamonds I could find and storing them
carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my provisions; this I tied
securely to my belt. I then chose the piece of meat which seemed most suited to
my purpose, and with the aid of my turban bound it firmly to my back; this done
I laid down upon my face and awaited the coming of the eagles. I soon heard the
flapping of their mighty wings above me, and had the satisfaction of feeling
one of them seize upon my piece of meat, and me with it, and rise slowly
towards his nest, into which he presently dropped me. Luckily for me the
merchants were on the watch, and setting up their usual outcries they rushed to
the nest scaring away the eagle. Their amazement was great when they discovered
me, and also their disappointment, and with one accord they fell to abusing me
for having robbed them of their usual profit. Addressing myself to the one who
seemed most aggrieved, I said: &quot;I am sure, if you knew all that I have
suffered, you would show more kindness towards me, and as for diamonds, I have
enough here of the very best for you and me and all your company.&quot; So
saying I showed them to him. The others all crowded round me, wondering at my
adventures and admiring the device by which I had escaped from the valley, and
when they had led me to their camp and examined my diamonds, they assured me
that in all the years that they had carried on their trade they had seen no
stones to be compared with them for size and beauty. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I found that each
merchant chose a particular nest, and took his chance of what he might find in
it. So I begged the one who owned the nest to which I had been carried to take
as much as he would of my treasure, but he contented himself with one stone,
and that by no means the largest, assuring me that with such a gem his fortune
was made, and he need toil no more. I stayed with the merchants several days,
and then as they were journeying homewards I gladly accompanied them. Our way
lay across high mountains infested with frightful serpents, but we had the good
luck to escape them and came at last to the seashore. Thence we sailed to the
isle of Rohat where the camphor trees grow to such a size that a hundred men
could shelter under one of them with ease. The sap flows from an incision made
high up in the tree into a vessel hung there to receive it, and soon hardens
into the substance called camphor, but the tree itself withers up and dies when
it has been so treated. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In this same island we
saw the rhinoceros, an animal which is smaller than the elephant and larger
than the buffalo. It has one horn about a cubit long which is solid, but has a
furrow from the base to the tip. Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of
a man. The rhinoceros fights with the elephant, and transfixing him with his
horn carries him off upon his head, but becoming blinded with the blood of his
enemy, he falls helpless to the ground, and then comes the roc, and clutches
them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young. This doubtless
astonishes you, but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for
yourself. For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful
things which we saw in this island. Before we left I exchanged one of my
diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited greatly on our
homeward way. At last we reached Balsora, whence I hastened to Bagdad, where my
first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor, after which I
settled down to enjoy tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and
pain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having thus related the
adventures of his second voyage, Sindbad again bestowed a hundred sequins upon
Hindbad, inviting him to come again on the following day and hear how he fared
upon his third voyage. The other guests also departed to their homes, but all
returned at the same hour next day, including the porter, whose former life of
hard work and poverty had already begun to seem to him like a bad dream. Again
after the feast was over did Sindbad claim the attention of his guests and began
the account of his third voyage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a very short time
the pleasant easy life I led made me quite forget the perils of my two voyages.
Moreover, as I was still in the prime of life, it pleased me better to be up
and doing. So once more providing myself with the rarest and choicest
merchandise of Bagdad, I conveyed it to Balsora, and set sail with other
merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands. We had touched at many ports
and made much profit, when one day upon the open sea we were caught by a
terrible wind which blew us completely out of our reckoning, and lasting for
several days finally drove us into harbour on a strange island. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I would rather
have come to anchor anywhere than here,&quot; quoth our captain. &quot;This
island and all adjoining it are inhabited by hairy savages, who are certain to
attack us, and whatever these dwarfs may do we dare not resist, since they
swarm like locusts, and if one of them is killed the rest will fall upon us,
and speedily make an end of us.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These words caused great
consternation among all the ship's company, and only too soon we were to find
out that the captain spoke truly. There appeared a vast multitude of hideous
savages, not more than two feet high and covered with reddish fur. Throwing
themselves into the waves they surrounded our vessel. Chattering meanwhile in a
language we could not understand, and clutching at ropes and gangways, they
swarmed up the ship's side with such speed and agility that they almost seemed
to fly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>You may imagine the rage
and terror that seized us as we watched them, neither daring to hinder them nor
able to speak a word to deter them from their purpose, whatever it might be. Of
this we were not left long in doubt. Hoisting the sails, and cutting the cable
of the anchor, they sailed our vessel to an island which lay a little further
off, where they drove us ashore; then taking possession of her, they made off
to the place from which they had come, leaving us helpless upon a shore avoided
with horror by all mariners for a reason which you will soon learn. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Turning away from the
sea we wandered miserably inland, finding as we went various herbs and fruits
which we ate, feeling that we might as well live as long as possible though we
had no hope of escape. Presently we saw in the far distance what seemed to us
to be a splendid palace, towards which we turned our weary steps, but when we
reached it we saw that it was a castle, lofty, and strongly built. Pushing back
the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard, but upon the threshold of the
great hall beyond it we paused, frozen with horror, at the sight which greeted
us. On one side lay a huge pile of bones--human bones, and on the other
numberless spits for roasting! Overcome with despair we sank trembling to the
ground, and lay there without speech or motion. The sun was setting when a loud
noise aroused us, the door of the hall was violently burst open and a horrible
giant entered. He was as tall as a palm tree, and perfectly black, and had one
eye, which flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead. His teeth
were long and sharp and grinned horribly, while his lower lip hung down upon
his chest, and he had ears like elephant's ears, which covered his shoulders,
and nails like the claws of some fierce bird. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this terrible sight
our senses left us and we lay like dead men. When at last we came to ourselves
the giant sat examining us attentively with his fearful eye. Presently when he
had looked at us enough he came towards us, and stretching out his hand took me
by the back of the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling that I was
mere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next, whom he
treated in the same fashion; at last he came to the captain, and finding him
the fattest of us all, he took him up in one hand and stuck him upon a spit and
proceeded to kindle a huge fire at which he presently roasted him. After the
giant had supped he lay down to sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder, while
we lay shivering with horror the whole night through, and when day broke he
awoke and went out, leaving us in the castle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When we believed him to
be really gone we started up bemoaning our horrible fate, until the hall echoed
with our despairing cries. Though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not
occur to us to kill him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even
if we had thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves. So
at last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day in wandering up and down
the island eating such fruits as we could find, and when night came we returned
to the castle, having sought in vain for any other place of shelter. At sunset
the giant returned, supped upon one of our unhappy comrades, slept and snored
till dawn, and then left us as before. Our condition seemed to us so frightful
that several of my companions thought it would be better to leap from the
cliffs and perish in the waves at once, rather than await so miserable an end;
but I had a plan of escape which I now unfolded to them, and which they at once
agreed to attempt. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Listen, my
brothers,&quot; I added. &quot;You know that plenty of driftwood lies along the
shore. Let us make several rafts, and carry them to a suitable place. If our
plot succeeds, we can wait patiently for the chance of some passing ship which
would rescue us from this fatal island. If it fails, we must quickly take to
our rafts; frail as they are, we have more chance of saving our lives with them
than we have if we remain here.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All agreed with me, and
we spent the day in building rafts, each capable of carrying three persons. At
nightfall we returned to the castle, and very soon in came the giant, and one
more of our number was sacrificed. But the time of our vengeance was at hand!
As soon as he had finished his horrible repast he lay down to sleep as before,
and when we heard him begin to snore I, and nine of the boldest of my comrades,
rose softly, and took each a spit, which we made red-hot in the fire, and then
at a given signal we plunged it with one accord into the giant's eye,
completely blinding him. Uttering a terrible cry, he sprang to his feet
clutching in all directions to try to seize one of us, but we had all fled
different ways as soon as the deed was done, and thrown ourselves flat upon the
ground in corners where he was not likely to touch us with his feet. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a vain search he
fumbled about till he found the door, and fled out of it howling frightfully.
As for us, when he was gone we made haste to leave the fatal castle, and,
stationing ourselves beside our rafts, we waited to see what would happen. Our
idea was that if, when the sun rose, we saw nothing of the giant, and no longer
heard his howls, which still came faintly through the darkness, growing more
and more distant, we should conclude that he was dead, and that we might safely
stay upon the island and need not risk our lives upon the frail rafts. But
alas! morning light showed us our enemy approaching us, supported on either
hand by two giants nearly as large and fearful as himself, while a crowd of
others followed close upon their heels. Hesitating no longer we clambered upon
our rafts and rowed with all our might out to sea. The giants, seeing their
prey escaping them, seized up huge pieces of rock, and wading into the water
hurled them after us with such good aim that all the rafts except the one I was
upon were swamped, and their luckless crews drowned, without our being able to
do anything to help them. Indeed I and my two companions had all we could do to
keep our own raft beyond the reach of the giants, but by dint of hard rowing we
at last gained the open sea. Here we were at the mercy of the winds and waves,
which tossed us to and fro all that day and night, but the next morning we
found ourselves near an island, upon which we gladly landed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There we found delicious
fruits, and having satisfied our hunger we presently lay down to rest upon the
shore. Suddenly we were aroused by a loud rustling noise, and starting up, saw
that it was caused by an immense snake which was gliding towards us over the
sand. So swiftly it came that it had seized one of my comrades before he had
time to fly, and in spite of his cries and struggles speedily crushed the life
out of him in its mighty coils and proceeded to swallow him. By this time my
other companion and I were running for our lives to some place where we might
hope to be safe from this new horror, and seeing a tall tree we climbed up into
it, having first provided ourselves with a store of fruit off the surrounding
bushes. When night came I fell asleep, but only to be awakened once more by the
terrible snake, which after hissing horribly round the tree at last reared
itself up against it, and finding my sleeping comrade who was perched just
below me, it swallowed him also, and crawled away leaving me half dead with
terror. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the sun rose I
crept down from the tree with hardly a hope of escaping the dreadful fate which
had over-taken my comrades; but life is sweet, and I determined to do all I
could to save myself. All day long I toiled with frantic haste and collected
quantities of dry brushwood, reeds and thorns, which I bound with faggots, and
making a circle of them under my tree I piled them firmly one upon another
until I had a kind of tent in which I crouched like a mouse in a hole when she
sees the cat coming. You may imagine what a fearful night I passed, for the
snake returned eager to devour me, and glided round and round my frail shelter
seeking an entrance. Every moment I feared that it would succeed in pushing
aside some of the faggots, but happily for me they held together, and when it
grew light my enemy retired, baffled and hungry, to his den. As for me I was
more dead than alive! Shaking with fright and half suffocated by the poisonous
breath of the monster, I came out of my tent and crawled down to the sea,
feeling that it would be better to plunge from the cliffs and end my life at
once than pass such another night of horror. But to my joy and relief I saw a
ship sailing by, and by shouting wildly and waving my turban I managed to attract
the attention of her crew. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A boat was sent to
rescue me, and very soon I found myself on board surrounded by a wondering
crowd of sailors and merchants eager to know by what chance I found myself in
that desolate island. After I had told my story they regaled me with the
choicest food the ship afforded, and the captain, seeing that I was in rags,
generously bestowed upon me one of his own coats. After sailing about for some
time and touching at many ports we came at last to the island of Salahat, where
sandal wood grows in great abundance. Here we anchored, and as I stood watching
the merchants disembarking their goods and preparing to sell or exchange them,
the captain came up to me and said, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have here,
brother, some merchandise belonging to a passenger of mine who is dead. Will
you do me the favour to trade with it, and when I meet with his heirs I shall
be able to give them the money, though it will be only just that you shall have
a portion for your trouble.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I consented gladly, for
I did not like standing by idle. Whereupon he pointed the bales out to me, and
sent for the person whose duty it was to keep a list of the goods that were
upon the ship. When this man came he asked in what name the merchandise was to
be registered. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;In the name of Sindbad
the Sailor,&quot; replied the captain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this I was greatly
surprised, but looking carefully at him I recognised him to be the captain of
the ship upon which I had made my second voyage, though he had altered much
since that time. As for him, believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he
had not recognised me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;So, captain,&quot;
said I, &quot;the merchant who owned those bales was called Sindbad?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; he
replied. &quot;He was so named. He belonged to Bagdad, and joined my ship at
Balsora, but by mischance he was left behind upon a desert island where we had
landed to fill up our water-casks, and it was not until four hours later that
he was missed. By that time the wind had freshened, and it was impossible to
put back for him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You suppose him to
have perished then?&quot; said I. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas! yes,&quot;
he answered. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why,
captain!&quot; I cried, &quot;look well at me. I am that Sindbad who fell
asleep upon the island and awoke to find himself abandoned!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The captain stared at me
in amazement, but was presently convinced that I was indeed speaking the truth,
and rejoiced greatly at my escape. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am glad to have
that piece of carelessness off my conscience at any rate,&quot; said he.
&quot;Now take your goods, and the profit I have made for you upon them, and
may you prosper in future.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I took them gratefully,
and as we went from one island to another I laid in stores of cloves, cinnamon,
and other spices. In one place I saw a tortoise which was twenty cubits long
and as many broad, also a fish that was like a cow and had skin so thick that it
was used to make shields. Another I saw that was like a camel in shape and
colour. So by degrees we came back to Balsora, and I returned to Bagdad with so
much money that I could not myself count it, besides treasures without end. I
gave largely to the poor, and bought much land to add to what I already
possessed, and thus ended my third voyage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Sindbad had
finished his story he gave another hundred sequins to Hindbad, who then
departed with the other guests, but next day when they had all reassembled, and
the banquet was ended, their host continued his adventures. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Rich and happy as I was
after my third voyage, I could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether.
My love of trading, and the pleasure I took in anything that was new and
strange, made me set my affairs in order, and begin my journey through some of
the Persian provinces, having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming
in the different places I intended to visit. I took ship at a distant seaport,
and for some time all went well, but at last, being caught in a violent
hurricane, our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain
could do to save her, and many of our company perished in the waves. I, with a
few others, had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the
wreck, for the storm had driven us near an island, and scrambling up beyond the
reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted, to wait for
morning. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At daylight we wandered
inland, and soon saw some huts, to which we directed our steps. As we drew near
their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us, and we
were led to their houses, and as it were divided among our captors. I with five
others was taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground, and
certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signs to us to eat.
Observing that they themselves did not touch them, I was careful only to
pretend to taste my portion; but my companions, being very hungry, rashly ate
up all that was set before them, and very soon I had the horror of seeing them
become perfectly mad. Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand
a word they said, nor did they heed when I spoke to them. The savages now
produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil, of which my crazy
comrades ate eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains, understanding clearly
that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating,
and this was exactly what happened. My unlucky companions having lost their
reason, felt neither anxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that was offered
them. So they were soon fat and there was an end of them, but I grew leaner day
by day, for I ate but little, and even that little did me no good by reason of
my fear of what lay before me. However, as I was so far from being a tempting
morsel, I was allowed to wander about freely, and one day, when all the blacks
had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I
managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest, running faster the more
he cried to me to come back, until I had completely distanced him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For seven days I hurried
on, resting only when the darkness stopped me, and living chiefly upon
cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat and drink, and on the eighth day I
reached the seashore and saw a party of white men gathering pepper, which grew
abundantly all about. Reassured by the nature of their occupation, I advanced
towards them and they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came.
My delight was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly satisfied
their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked, and captured by the
blacks. &quot;But these savages devour men!&quot; said they. &quot;How did you
escape?&quot; I repeated to them what I have just told you, at which they were
mightily astonished. I stayed with them until they had collected as much pepper
as they wished, and then they took me back to their own country and presented
me to their king, by whom I was hospitably received. To him also I had to
relate my adventures, which surprised him much, and when I had finished he
ordered that I should be supplied with food and raiment and treated with
consideration. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The island on which I
found myself was full of people, and abounded in all sorts of desirable things,
and a great deal of traffic went on in the capital, where I soon began to feel
at home and contented. Moreover, the king treated me with special favour, and
in consequence of this everyone, whether at the court or in the town, sought to
make life pleasant to me. One thing I remarked which I thought very strange;
this was that, from the greatest to the least, all men rode their horses
without bridle or stirrups. I one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did
not use them, to which he replied, &quot;You speak to me of things of which I
have never before heard!&quot; This gave me an idea. I found a clever workman,
and made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle, which I
wadded and covered with choice leather, adorning it with rich gold embroidery.
I then got a lock-smith to make me a bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern
that I drew for him, and when all these things were completed I presented them
to the king and showed him how to use them. When I had saddled one of his
horses he mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty, and to
show his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts. After this I had to make
saddles for all the principal officers of the king's household, and as they all
gave me rich presents I soon became very wealthy and quite an important person
in the city. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day the king sent
for me and said, &quot;Sindbad, I am going to ask a favour of you. Both I and
my subjects esteem you, and wish you to end your days amongst us. Therefore I
desire that you will marry a rich and beautiful lady whom I will find for you,
and think no more of your own country.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As the king's will was
law I accepted the charming bride he presented to me, and lived happily with
her. Nevertheless I had every intention of escaping at the first opportunity,
and going back to Bagdad. Things were thus going prosperously with me when it
happened that the wife of one of my neighbours, with whom I had struck up quite
a friendship, fell ill, and presently died. I went to his house to offer my
consolations, and found him in the depths of woe. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Heaven preserve
you,&quot; said I, &quot;and send you a long life!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot; he
replied, &quot;what is the good of saying that when I have but an hour left to
live!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Come, come!&quot;
said I, &quot;surely it is not so bad as all that. I trust that you may be
spared to me for many years.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I hope,&quot;
answered he, &quot;that your life may be long, but as for me, all is finished.
I have set my house in order, and to-day I shall be buried with my wife. This
has been the law upon our island from the earliest ages--the living husband
goes to the grave with his dead wife, the living wife with her dead husband. So
did our fathers, and so must we do. The law changes not, and all must submit to
it!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he spoke the friends
and relations of the unhappy pair began to assemble. The body, decked in rich
robes and sparkling with jewels, was laid upon an open bier, and the procession
started, taking its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city, the
wretched husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle, following
mournfully. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the place of
interment was reached the corpse was lowered, just as it was, into a deep pit.
Then the husband, bidding farewell to all his friends, stretched himself upon
another bier, upon which were laid seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher
of water, and he also was let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible
cavern, and then a stone was laid over the opening, and the melancholy company
wended its way back to the city. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>You may imagine that I
was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings; to all the others it was a thing
to which they had been accustomed from their youth up; but I was so horrified
that I could not help telling the king how it struck me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; I said,
&quot;I am more astonished than I can express to you at the strange custom
which exists in your dominions of burying the living with the dead. In all my
travels I have never before met with so cruel and horrible a law.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What would you
have, Sindbad?&quot; he replied. &quot;It is the law for everybody. I myself
should be buried with the Queen if she were the first to die.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But, your
Majesty,&quot; said I, &quot;dare I ask if this law applies to foreigners
also?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why, yes,&quot;
replied the king smiling, in what I could but consider a very heartless manner,
&quot;they are no exception to the rule if they have married in the
country.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I heard this I went
home much cast down, and from that time forward my mind was never easy. If only
my wife's little finger ached I fancied she was going to die, and sure enough
before very long she fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last. My
dismay was great, for it seemed to me that to be buried alive was even a worse
fate than to be devoured by cannibals, nevertheless there was no escape. The
body of my wife, arrayed in her richest robes and decked with all her jewels,
was laid upon the bier. I followed it, and after me came a great procession,
headed by the king and all his nobles, and in this order we reached the fatal
mountain, which was one of a lofty chain bordering the sea. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Here I made one more
frantic effort to excite the pity of the king and those who stood by, hoping to
save myself even at this last moment, but it was of no avail. No one spoke to
me, they even appeared to hasten over their dreadful task, and I speedily found
myself descending into the gloomy pit, with my seven loaves and pitcher of
water beside me. Almost before I reached the bottom the stone was rolled into
its place above my head, and I was left to my fate. A feeble ray of light shone
into the cavern through some chink, and when I had the courage to look about me
I could see that I was in a vast vault, bestrewn with bones and bodies of the
dead. I even fancied that I heard the expiring sighs of those who, like myself,
had come into this dismal place alive. All in vain did I shriek aloud with rage
and despair, reproaching myself for the love of gain and adventure which had
brought me to such a pass, but at length, growing calmer, I took up my bread
and water, and wrapping my face in my mantle I groped my way towards the end of
the cavern, where the air was fresher. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Here I lived in darkness
and misery until my provisions were exhausted, but just as I was nearly dead
from starvation the rock was rolled away overhead and I saw that a bier was
being lowered into the cavern, and that the corpse upon it was a man. In a
moment my mind was made up, the woman who followed had nothing to expect but a
lingering death; I should be doing her a service if I shortened her misery.
Therefore when she descended, already insensible from terror, I was ready armed
with a huge bone, one blow from which left her dead, and I secured the bread
and water which gave me a hope of life. Several times did I have recourse to
this desperate expedient, and I know not how long I had been a prisoner when
one day I fancied that I heard something near me, which breathed loudly.
Turning to the place from which the sound came I dimly saw a shadowy form which
fled at my movement, squeezing itself through a cranny in the wall. I pursued
it as fast as I could, and found myself in a narrow crack among the rocks,
along which I was just able to force my way. I followed it for what seemed to
me many miles, and at last saw before me a glimmer of light which grew clearer
every moment until I emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which I cannot
describe. When I was sure that I was not dreaming, I realised that it was
doubtless some little animal which had found its way into the cavern from the
sea, and when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of escape which I could
never have discovered for myself. I hastily surveyed my surroundings, and saw
that I was safe from all pursuit from the town. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The mountains sloped
sheer down to the sea, and there was no road across them. Being assured of this
I returned to the cavern, and amassed a rich treasure of diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, and jewels of all kinds which strewed the ground. These I made up
into bales, and stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then waited hopefully
for the passing of a ship. I had looked out for two days, however, before a
single sail appeared, so it was with much delight that I at last saw a vessel
not very far from the shore, and by waving my arms and uttering loud cries
succeeded in attracting the attention of her crew. A boat was sent off to me,
and in answer to the questions of the sailors as to how I came to be in such a
plight, I replied that I had been shipwrecked two days before, but had managed
to scramble ashore with the bales which I pointed out to them. Luckily for me
they believed my story, and without even looking at the place where they found
me, took up my bundles, and rowed me back to the ship. Once on board, I soon
saw that the captain was too much occupied with the difficulties of navigation
to pay much heed to me, though he generously made me welcome, and would not
even accept the jewels with which I offered to pay my passage. Our voyage was
prosperous, and after visiting many lands, and collecting in each place great
store of goodly merchandise, I found myself at last in Bagdad once more with
unheard of riches of every description. Again I gave large sums of money to the
poor, and enriched all the mosques in the city, after which I gave myself up to
my friends and relations, with whom I passed my time in feasting and merriment.

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Here Sindbad paused, and
all his hearers declared that the adventures of his fourth voyage had pleased
them better than anything they had heard before. They then took their leave,
followed by Hindbad, who had once more received a hundred sequins, and with the
rest had been bidden to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Not even all that I had
gone through could make me contented with a quiet life. I soon wearied of its
pleasures, and longed for change and adventure. Therefore I set out once more,
but this time in a ship of my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest
seaport. I wished to be able to call at whatever port I chose, taking my own
time; but as I did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo, I invited
several merchants of different nations to join me. We set sail with the first favourable
wind, and after a long voyage upon the open seas we landed upon an unknown
island which proved to be uninhabited. We determined, however, to explore it,
but had not gone far when we found a roc's egg, as large as the one I had seen
before and evidently very nearly hatched, for the beak of the young bird had
already pierced the shell. In spite of all I could say to deter them, the
merchants who were with me fell upon it with their hatchets, breaking the
shell, and killing the young roc. Then lighting a fire upon the ground they
hacked morsels from the bird, and proceeded to roast them while I stood by
aghast. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarcely had they
finished their ill-omened repast, when the air above us was darkened by two
mighty shadows. The captain of my ship, knowing by experience what this meant,
cried out to us that the parent birds were coming, and urged us to get on board
with all speed. This we did, and the sails were hoisted, but before we had made
any way the rocs reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it, uttering
frightful cries when they discovered the mangled remains of their young one.
For a moment we lost sight of them, and were flattering ourselves that we had
escaped, when they reappeared and soared into the air directly over our vessel,
and we saw that each held in its claws an immense rock ready to crush us. There
was a moment of breathless suspense, then one bird loosed its hold and the huge
block of stone hurtled through the air, but thanks to the presence of mind of
the helmsman, who turned our ship violently in another direction, it fell into
the sea close beside us, cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the
bottom. We had hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock
fell with a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel, smashing it
into a thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling into the sea, passengers
and crew. I myself went down with the rest, but had the good fortune to rise
unhurt, and by holding on to a piece of driftwood with one hand and swimming with
the other I kept myself afloat and was presently washed up by the tide on to an
island. Its shores were steep and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threw
myself down to rest upon the green turf. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I had somewhat
recovered I began to examine the spot in which I found myself, and truly it
seemed to me that I had reached a garden of delights. There were trees
everywhere, and they were laden with flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream
wandered in and out under their shadow. When night came I slept sweetly in a
cosy nook, though the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made me
sometimes start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wished heartily that
I had stayed at home at ease. However, the morning sunlight restored my
courage, and I once more wandered among the trees, but always with some anxiety
as to what I might see next. I had penetrated some distance into the island
when I saw an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank, and at first
I took him to be some ship-wrecked mariner like myself. Going up to him I
greeted him in a friendly way, but he only nodded his head at me in reply. I
then asked what he did there, and he made signs to me that he wished to get
across the river to gather some fruit, and seemed to beg me to carry him on my
back. Pitying his age and feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the
stream I bent down that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade him get
down. But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet (even now it
makes me laugh to think of it!), this creature who had seemed to me so decrepit
leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking his legs round my neck gripped me
so tightly that I was well-nigh choked, and so overcome with terror that I fell
insensible to the ground. When I recovered my enemy was still in his place,
though he had released his hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing
me revive he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other,
until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the trees while
he gathered and ate the choicest fruits. This went on all day, and even at
night, when I threw myself down half dead with weariness, the terrible old man
held on tight to my neck, nor did he fail to greet the first glimmer of morning
light by drumming upon me with his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my
dreary march with rage and bitterness in my heart. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened one day that
I passed a tree under which lay several dry gourds, and catching one up I
amused myself with scooping out its contents and pressing into it the juice of
several bunches of grapes which hung from every bush. When it was full I left
it propped in the fork of a tree, and a few days later, carrying the hateful
old man that way, I snatched at my gourd as I passed it and had the
satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that I even
forgot my detestable burden, and began to sing and caper. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old monster was not
slow to perceive the effect which my draught had produced and that I carried
him more lightly than usual, so he stretched out his skinny hand and seizing
the gourd first tasted its contents cautiously, then drained them to the very
last drop. The wine was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also began to
sing after a fashion, and soon I had the delight of feeling the iron grip of
his goblin legs unclasp, and with one vigorous effort I threw him to the
ground, from which he never moved again. I was so rejoiced to have at last got
rid of this uncanny old man that I ran leaping and bounding down to the sea
shore, where, by the greatest good luck, I met with some mariners who had
anchored off the island to enjoy the delicious fruits, and to renew their
supply of water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They heard the story of
my escape with amazement, saying, &quot;You fell into the hands of the Old Man
of the Sea, and it is a mercy that he did not strangle you as he has everyone
else upon whose shoulders he has managed to perch himself. This island is well
known as the scene of his evil deeds, and no merchant or sailor who lands upon
it cares to stray far away from his comrades.&quot; After we had talked for a
while they took me back with them on board their ship, where the captain
received me kindly, and we soon set sail, and after several days reached a
large and prosperous-looking town where all the houses were built of stone.
Here we anchored, and one of the merchants, who had been very friendly to me on
the way, took me ashore with him and showed me a lodging set apart for strange
merchants. He then provided me with a large sack, and pointed out to me a party
of others equipped in like manner. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go with
them,&quot; said he, &quot;and do as they do, but beware of losing sight of
them, for if you strayed your life would be in danger.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With that he supplied me
with provisions, and bade me farewell, and I set out with my new companions. I
soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with
cocoanuts, but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height
and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks, I did not at all
understand how we were to do it. The crowns of the cocoa-palms were all alive
with monkeys, big and little, which skipped from one to the other with
surprising agility, seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance,
and I was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began
to throw them at the lively creatures, which seemed to me quite harmless. But
very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily, for the monkeys,
annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin, began to tear the nuts from
the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful gestures, so that after
very little labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not
otherwise have obtained. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as we had as
many as we could carry we went back to the town, where my friend bought my
share and advised me to continue the same occupation until I had earned money
enough to carry me to my own country. This I did, and before long had amassed a
considerable sum. Just then I heard that there was a trading ship ready to
sail, and taking leave of my friend I went on board, carrying with me a goodly
store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first to the islands where pepper grows, then
to Comari where the best aloes wood is found, and where men drink no wine by an
unalterable law. Here I exchanged my nuts for pepper and good aloes wood, and
went a-fishing for pearls with some of the other merchants, and my divers were
so lucky that very soon I had an immense number, and those very large and
perfect. With all these treasures I came joyfully back to Bagdad, where I
disposed of them for large sums of money, of which I did not fail as before to
give the tenth part to the poor, and after that I rested from my labours and
comforted myself with all the pleasures that my riches could give me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having thus ended his
story, Sindbad ordered that one hundred sequins should be given to Hindbad, and
the guests then withdrew; but after the next day's feast he began the account
of his sixth voyage as follows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It must be a marvel to
you how, after having five times met with shipwreck and unheard of perils, I
could again tempt fortune and risk fresh trouble. I am even surprised myself
when I look back, but evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of
repose I prepared to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties of my
friends and relations, who did all they could to keep me at home. Instead of
going by the Persian Gulf, I travelled a considerable way overland, and finally
embarked from a distant Indian port with a captain who meant to make a long
voyage. And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy weather which drove us
completely out of our course, so that for many days neither captain nor pilot
knew where we were, nor where we were going. When they did at last discover our
position we had small ground for rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban
upon the deck and tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most
dangerous spot upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current which
was at that minute sweeping us to destruction. It was too true! In spite of all
the sailors could do we were driven with frightful rapidity towards the foot of
a mountain, which rose sheer out of the sea, and our vessel was dashed to pieces
upon the rocks at its base, not, however, until we had managed to scramble on
shore, carrying with us the most precious of our possessions. When we had done
this the captain said to us: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now we are here we
may as well begin to dig our graves at once, since from this fatal spot no
shipwrecked mariner has ever returned.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This speech discouraged
us much, and we began to lament over our sad fate. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The mountain formed the
seaward boundary of a large island, and the narrow strip of rocky shore upon
which we stood was strewn with the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while
the bones of the luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we
shuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap. All around,
too, lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise, and treasures were
heaped in every cranny of the rocks, but all these things only added to the
desolation of the scene. It struck me as a very strange thing that a river of
clear fresh water, which gushed out from the mountain not far from where we
stood, instead of flowing into the sea as rivers generally do, turned off
sharply, and flowed out of sight under a natural archway of rock, and when I
went to examine it more closely I found that inside the cave the walls were
thick with diamonds, and rubies, and masses of crystal, and the floor was
strewn with ambergris. Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned
ourselves to our fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain,
and if a ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom. The first thing
our captain did was to divide equally amongst us all the food we possessed, and
then the length of each man's life depended on the time he could make his
portion last. I myself could live upon very little. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Nevertheless, by the
time I had buried the last of my companions my stock of provisions was so small
that I hardly thought I should live long enough to dig my own grave, which I
set about doing, while I regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was
always bringing me into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfort
and luxury that I had left. But luckily for me the fancy took me to stand once
more beside the river where it plunged out of sight in the depths of the
cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me. This river which hid itself
underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot. Why should I not
build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flowing waters? If I perished
before I could reach the light of day once more I should be no worse off than I
was now, for death stared me in the face, while there was always the
possibility that, as I was born under a lucky star, I might find myself safe
and sound in some desirable land. I decided at any rate to risk it, and
speedily built myself a stout raft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which
enough and to spare lay strewn upon the beach. I then made up many packages of
rubies, emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and bound them
upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and then I seated myself
upon it, having two small oars that I had fashioned laid ready to my hand, and
loosed the cord which held it to the bank. Once out in the current my raft flew
swiftly under the gloomy archway, and I found myself in total darkness, carried
smoothly forward by the rapid river. On I went as it seemed to me for many
nights and days. Once the channel became so small that I had a narrow escape of
being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I took the precaution of
lying flat upon my precious bales. Though I only ate what was absolutely
necessary to keep myself alive, the inevitable moment came when, after
swallowing my last morsel of food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of
hunger. Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep, and
when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light of day; a beautiful
country lay before me, and my raft, which was tied to the river bank, was
surrounded by friendly looking black men. I rose and saluted them, and they spoke
to me in return, but I could not understand a word of their language. Feeling
perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to
myself in Arabic, &quot;Close thine eyes, and while thou sleepest Heaven will
change thy fortune from evil to good.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One of the natives, who
understood this tongue, then came forward saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother, be not
surprised to see us; this is our land, and as we came to get water from the
river we noticed your raft floating down it, and one of us swam out and brought
you to the shore. We have waited for your awakening; tell us now whence you
come and where you were going by that dangerous way?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I replied that nothing
would please me better than to tell them, but that I was starving, and would
fain eat something first. I was soon supplied with all I needed, and having
satisfied my hunger I told them faithfully all that had befallen me. They were
lost in wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them, and said that
adventures so surprising must be related to their king only by the man to whom
they had happened. So, procuring a horse, they mounted me upon it, and we set
out, followed by several strong men carrying my raft just as it was upon their
shoulders. In this order we marched into the city of Serendib, where the
natives presented me to their king, whom I saluted in the Indian fashion,
prostrating myself at his feet and kissing the ground; but the monarch bade me
rise and sit beside him, asking first what was my name. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am

much upon many seas.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And how come you
here?&quot; asked the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I told my story,
concealing nothing, and his surprise and delight were so great that he ordered
my adventures to be written in letters of gold and laid up in the archives of
his kingdom. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Presently my raft was
brought in and the bales opened in his presence, and the king declared that in
all his treasury there were no such rubies and emeralds as those which lay in
great heaps before him. Seeing that he looked at them with interest, I ventured
to say that I myself and all that I had were at his disposal, but he answered
me smiling: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Nay, Sindbad.
Heaven forbid that I should covet your riches; I will rather add to them, for I
desire that you shall not leave my kingdom without some tokens of my good
will.&quot; He then commanded his officers to provide me with a suitable
lodging at his expense, and sent slaves to wait upon me and carry my raft and
my bales to my new dwelling place. You may imagine that I praised his
generosity and gave him grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myself daily
in his audience chamber, and for the rest of my time I amused myself in seeing
all that was most worthy of attention in the city. The island of Serendib being
situated on the equinoctial line, the days and nights there are of equal
length. The chief city is placed at the end of a beautiful valley, formed by
the highest mountain in the world, which is in the middle of the island. I had
the curiosity to ascend to its very summit, for this was the place to which
Adam was banished out of Paradise. Here are found rubies and many precious
things, and rare plants grow abundantly, with cedar trees and cocoa palms. On
the seashore and at the mouths of the rivers the divers seek for pearls, and in
some valleys diamonds are plentiful. After many days I petitioned the king that
I might return to my own country, to which he graciously consented. Moreover,
he loaded me with rich gifts, and when I went to take leave of him he entrusted
me with a royal present and a letter to the Commander of the Faithful, our
sovereign lord, saying, &quot;I pray you give these to the Caliph Haroun al
Raschid, and assure him of my friendship.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I accepted the charge
respectfully, and soon embarked upon the vessel which the king himself had
chosen for me. The king's letter was written in blue characters upon a rare and
precious skin of yellowish colour, and these were the words of it: &quot;The
King of the Indies, before whom walk a thousand elephants, who lives in a
palace, of which the roof blazes with a hundred thousand rubies, and whose
treasure house contains twenty thousand diamond crowns, to the Caliph Haroun al
Raschid sends greeting. Though the offering we present to you is unworthy of
your notice, we pray you to accept it as a mark of the esteem and friendship
which we cherish for you, and of which we gladly send you this token, and we
ask of you a like regard if you deem us worthy of it. Adieu, brother.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The present consisted of
a vase carved from a single ruby, six inches high and as thick as my finger;
this was filled with the choicest pearls, large, and of perfect shape and
lustre; secondly, a huge snake skin, with scales as large as a sequin, which
would preserve from sickness those who slept upon it. Then quantities of aloes
wood, camphor, and pistachio-nuts; and lastly, a beautiful slave girl, whose
robes glittered with precious stones. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a long and
prosperous voyage we landed at Balsora, and I made haste to reach Bagdad, and
taking the king's letter I presented myself at the palace gate, followed by the
beautiful slave, and various members of my own family, bearing the treasure. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as I had
declared my errand I was conducted into the presence of the Caliph, to whom,
after I had made my obeisance, I gave the letter and the king's gift, and when
he had examined them he demanded of me whether the Prince of Serendib was
really as rich and powerful as he claimed to be. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Commander of the
Faithful,&quot; I replied, again bowing humbly before him, &quot;I can assure
your Majesty that he has in no way exaggerated his wealth and grandeur. Nothing
can equal the magnificence of his palace. When he goes abroad his throne is
prepared upon the back of an elephant, and on either side of him ride his
ministers, his favourites, and courtiers. On his elephant's neck sits an
officer, his golden lance in his hand, and behind him stands another bearing a
pillar of gold, at the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand. A thousand
men in cloth of gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants, go before him,
and as the procession moves onward the officer who guides his elephant cries
aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch, the powerful and valiant Sultan of the
Indies, whose palace is covered with a hundred thousand rubies, who possesses
twenty thousand diamond crowns. Behold a monarch greater than Solomon and
Mihrage in all their glory!'&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then the one who
stands behind the throne answers: 'This king, so great and powerful, must die,
must die, must die!'&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And the first
takes up the chant again, `All praise to Him who lives for evermore.'&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Further, my lord,
in Serendib no judge is needed, for to the king himself his people come for
justice.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph was well
satisfied with my report. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;From the king's
letter,&quot; said he, &quot;I judged that he was a wise man. It seems that he
is worthy of his people, and his people of him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying he dismissed
me with rich presents, and I returned in peace to my own house. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Sindbad had done
speaking his guests withdrew, Hindbad having first received a hundred sequins,
but all returned next day to hear the story of the seventh voyage, Sindbad thus
began. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After my sixth voyage I
was quite determined that I would go to sea no more. I was now of an age to
appreciate a quiet life, and I had run risks enough. I only wished to end my
days in peace. One day, however, when I was entertaining a number of my
friends, I was told that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me, and
when he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of Haroun al
Raschid, which I accordingly did. After I had saluted him, the Caliph said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have sent for
you, Sindbad, because I need your services. I have chosen you to bear a letter
and a gift to the King of Serendib in return for his message of
friendship.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph's commandment
fell upon me like a thunderbolt. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Commander of the
Faithful,&quot; I answered, &quot;I am ready to do all that your Majesty
commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I am utterly disheartened by
the unheard of sufferings I have undergone. Indeed, I have made a vow never
again to leave Bagdad.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With this I gave him a
long account of some of my strangest adventures, to which he listened
patiently. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I admit,&quot;
said he, &quot;that you have indeed had some extraordinary experiences, but I
do not see why they should hinder you from doing as I wish. You have only to go
straight to Serendib and give my message, then you are free to come back and do
as you will. But go you must; my honour and dignity demand it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Seeing that there was no
help for it, I declared myself willing to obey; and the Caliph, delighted at
having got his own way, gave me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the
voyage. I was soon ready to start, and taking the letter and the present I
embarked at Balsora, and sailed quickly and safely to Serendib. Here, when I
had disclosed my errand, I was well received, and brought into the presence of
the king, who greeted me with joy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Welcome,
Sindbad,&quot; he cried. &quot;I have thought of you often, and rejoice to see
you once more.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After thanking him for
the honour that he did me, I displayed the Caliph's gifts. First a bed with
complete hangings all cloth of gold, which cost a thousand sequins, and another
like to it of crimson stuff. Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the
finest white linen from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria. Then more beds of
different fashion, and an agate vase carved with the figure of a man aiming an
arrow at a lion, and finally a costly table, which had once belonged to King
Solomon. The King of Serendib received with satisfaction the assurance of the
Caliph's friendliness toward him, and now my task being accomplished I was
anxious to depart, but it was some time before the king would think of letting
me go. At last, however, he dismissed me with many presents, and I lost no time
in going on board a ship, which sailed at once, and for four days all went
well. On the fifth day we had the misfortune to fall in with pirates, who
seized our vessel, killing all who resisted, and making prisoners of those who
were prudent enough to submit at once, of whom I was one. When they had
despoiled us of all we possessed, they forced us to put on vile raiment, and
sailing to a distant island there sold us for slaves. I fell into the hands of
a rich merchant, who took me home with him, and clothed and fed me well, and
after some days sent for me and questioned me as to what I could do. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I answered that I was a
rich merchant who had been captured by pirates, and therefore I knew no trade. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell me,&quot;
said he, &quot;can you shoot with a bow?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I replied that this had
been one of the pastimes of my youth, and that doubtless with practice my skill
would come back to me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Upon this he provided me
with a bow and arrows, and mounting me with him upon his own elephant took the
way to a vast forest which lay far from the town. When we had reached the
wildest part of it we stopped, and my master said to me: &quot;This forest
swarms with elephants. Hide yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that
pass you. When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying he gave me a
supply of food, and returned to the town, and I perched myself high up in the
tree and kept watch. That night I saw nothing, but just after sunrise the next
morning a large herd of elephants came crashing and trampling by. I lost no
time in letting fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animals fell
to the ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me free to come down from
my hiding place and run back to tell my master of my success, for which I was
praised and regaled with good things. Then we went back to the forest together
and dug a mighty trench in which we buried the elephant I had killed, in order
that when it became a skeleton my master might return and secure its tusks. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For two months I hunted
thus, and no day passed without my securing, an elephant. Of course I did not
always station myself in the same tree, but sometimes in one place, sometimes in
another. One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised
to see that, instead of passing the tree I was in, as they usually did, they
paused, and completely surrounded it, trumpeting horribly, and shaking the very
ground with their heavy tread, and when I saw that their eyes were fixed upon
me I was terrified, and my arrows dropped from my trembling hand. I had indeed
good reason for my terror when, an instant later, the largest of the animals
wound his trunk round the stem of my tree, and with one mighty effort tore it
up by the roots, bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches. I thought
now that my last hour was surely come; but the huge creature, picking me up
gently enough, set me upon its back, where I clung more dead than alive, and
followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest. It
seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the
elephant, and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd, which turned and
trampled off in another direction, and were soon hidden in the dense underwood.
Then, recovering myself, I looked about me, and found that I was standing upon
the side of a great hill, strewn as far as I could see on either hand with
bones and tusks of elephants. &quot;This then must be the elephants' burying
place,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;and they must have brought me here that I
might cease to persecute them, seeing that I want nothing but their tusks, and
here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whereupon I turned and
made for the city as fast as I could go, not seeing a single elephant by the
way, which convinced me that they had retired deeper into the forest to leave
the way open to the Ivory Hill, and I did not know how sufficiently to admire
their sagacity. After a day and a night I reached my master's house, and was
received by him with joyful surprise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah! poor
Sindbad,&quot; he cried, &quot;I was wondering what could have become of you.
When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted, and the arrows lying
beside it, and I feared I should never see you again. Pray tell me how you
escaped death.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I soon satisfied his
curiosity, and the next day we went together to the Ivory Hill, and he was
overjoyed to find that I had told him nothing but the truth. When we had loaded
our elephant with as many tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to
the city, he said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother--since
I can no longer treat as a slave one who has enriched me thus--take your
liberty and may Heaven prosper you. I will no longer conceal from you that
these wild elephants have killed numbers of our slaves every year. No matter
what good advice we gave them, they were caught sooner or later. You alone have
escaped the wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under the special protection
of Heaven. Now through you the whole town will be enriched without further loss
of life, therefore you shall not only receive your liberty, but I will also
bestow a fortune upon you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To which I replied,
&quot;Master, I thank you, and wish you all prosperity. For myself I only ask
liberty to return to my own country.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is well,&quot;
he answered, &quot;the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ships hither, then I
will send you on your way with somewhat to pay your passage.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So I stayed with him
till the time of the monsoon, and every day we added to our store of ivory till
all his ware-houses were overflowing with it. By this time the other merchants
knew the secret, but there was enough and to spare for all. When the ships at
last arrived my master himself chose the one in which I was to sail, and put on
board for me a great store of choice provisions, also ivory in abundance, and
all the costliest curiosities of the country, for which I could not thank him
enough, and so we parted. I left the ship at the first port we came to, not
feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had happened to me by reason of it,
and having disposed of my ivory for much gold, and bought many rare and costly
presents, I loaded my pack animals, and joined a caravan of merchants. Our journey
was long and tedious, but I bore it patiently, reflecting that at least I had
not to fear tempests, nor pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perils
from which I had suffered before, and at length we reached Bagdad. My first
care was to present myself before the Caliph, and give him an account of my
embassy. He assured me that my long absence had disquieted him much, but he had
nevertheless hoped for the best. As to my adventure among the elephants he
heard it with amazement, declaring that he could not have believed it had not
my truthfulness been well known to him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By his orders this story
and the others I had told him were written by his scribes in letters of gold,
and laid up among his treasures. I took my leave of him, well satisfied with the
honours and rewards he bestowed upon me; and since that time I have rested from
my labours, and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus Sindbad ended the
story of his seventh and last voyage, and turning to Hindbad he added: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, my friend,
and what do you think now? Have you ever heard of anyone who has suffered more,
or had more narrow escapes than I have? Is it not just that I should now enjoy
a life of ease and tranquillity?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hindbad drew near, and
kissing his hand respectfully, replied, &quot;Sir, you have indeed known
fearful perils; my troubles have been nothing compared to yours. Moreover, the
generous use you make of your wealth proves that you deserve it. May you live
long and happily in the enjoyment in it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sindbad then gave him a
hundred sequins, and hence-forward counted him among his friends; also he
caused him to give up his profession as a porter, and to eat daily at his table
that he might all his life remember Sindbad the Sailor. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Little Hunchback</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the kingdom of
Kashgar, which is, as everybody knows, situated on the frontiers of Great
Tartary, there lived long ago a tailor and his wife who loved each other very
much. One day, when the tailor was hard at work, a little hunchback came and
sat at the entrance of the shop, and began to sing and play his tambourine. The
tailor was amused with the antics of the fellow, and thought he would take him
home to divert his wife. The hunchback having agreed to his proposal, the
tailor closed his shop and they set off together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they reached the
house they found the table ready laid for supper, and in a very few minutes all
three were sitting before a beautiful fish which the tailor's wife had cooked
with her own hands. But unluckily, the hunchback happened to swallow a large
bone, and, in spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help him, died
of suffocation in an instant. Besides being very sorry for the poor man, the
tailor and his wife were very much frightened on their own account, for if the
police came to hear of it the worthy couple ran the risk of being thrown into
prison for wilful murder. In order to prevent this dreadful calamity they both
set about inventing some plan which would throw suspicion on some one else, and
at last they made up their minds that they could do no better than select a
Jewish doctor who lived close by as the author of the crime. So the tailor
picked up the hunchback by his head while his wife took his feet and carried
him to the doctor's house. Then they knocked at the door, which opened straight
on to a steep staircase. A servant soon appeared, feeling her way down the dark
staircase and inquired what they wanted. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell your
master,&quot; said the tailor, &quot;that we have brought a very sick man for
him to cure; and,&quot; he added, holding out some money, &quot;give him this
in advance, so that he may not feel he is wasting his time.&quot; The servant
remounted the stairs to give the message to the doctor, and the moment she was
out of sight the tailor and his wife carried the body swiftly after her,
propped it up at the top of the staircase, and ran home as fast as their legs
could carry them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the doctor was so
delighted at the news of a patient (for he was young, and had not many of
them), that he was transported with joy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Get a light,&quot;
he called to the servant, &quot;and follow me as fast as you can!&quot; and
rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase. There he nearly fell over
the body of the hunchback, and without knowing what it was gave it such a kick
that it rolled right to the bottom, and very nearly dragged the doctor after
it. &quot;A light! a light!&quot; he cried again, and when it was brought and
he saw what he had done he was almost beside himself with terror. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Holy Moses!&quot;
he exclaimed, &quot;why did I not wait for the light? I have killed the sick
man whom they brought me; and if the sacred Ass of Esdras does not come to my
aid I am lost! It will not be long before I am led to jail as a murderer.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Agitated though he was,
and with reason, the doctor did not forget to shut the house door, lest some
passers-by might chance to see what had happened. He then took up the corpse
and carried it into his wife's room, nearly driving her crazy with fright. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is all over
with us!&quot; she wailed, &quot;if we cannot find some means of getting the
body out of the house. Once let the sun rise and we can hide it no longer! How
were you driven to commit such a terrible crime?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Never mind
that,&quot; returned the doctor, &quot;the thing is to find a way out of
it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For a long while the
doctor and his wife continued to turn over in their minds a way of escape, but
could not find any that seemed good enough. At last the doctor gave it up
altogether and resigned himself to bear the penalty of his misfortune. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But his wife, who had
twice his brains, suddenly exclaimed, &quot;I have thought of something! Let us
carry the body on the roof of the house and lower it down the chimney of our
neighbour the Mussulman.&quot; Now this Mussulman was employed by the Sultan,
and furnished his table with oil and butter. Part of his house was occupied by
a great storeroom, where rats and mice held high revel. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The doctor jumped at his
wife's plan, and they took up the hunchback, and passing cords under his
armpits they let him down into the purveyor's bed-room so gently that he really
seemed to be leaning against the wall. When they felt he was touching the
ground they drew up the cords and left him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarcely had they got
back to their own house when the purveyor entered his room. He had spent the
evening at a wedding feast, and had a lantern in his hand. In the dim light it
cast he was astonished to see a man standing in his chimney, but being
naturally courageous he seized a stick and made straight for the supposed
thief. &quot;Ah!&quot; he cried, &quot;so it is you, and not the rats and mice,
who steal my butter. I'll take care that you don't want to come back!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying he struck him
several hard blows. The corpse fell on the floor, but the man only redoubled
his blows, till at length it occurred to him it was odd that the thief should
lie so still and make no resistance. Then, finding he was quite dead, a cold
fear took possession of him. &quot;Wretch that I am,&quot; said he, &quot;I
have murdered a man. Ah, my revenge has gone too far. Without the help of Allah
I am undone! Cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin.&quot; And already
he felt the rope round his neck. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But when he had got over
the first shock he began to think of some way out of the difficulty, and
seizing the hunchback in his arms he carried him out into the street, and
leaning him against the wall of a shop he stole back to his own house, without
once looking behind him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A few minutes before the
sun rose, a rich Christian merchant, who supplied the palace with all sorts of
necessaries, left his house, after a night of feasting, to go to the bath.
Though he was very drunk, he was yet sober enough to know that the dawn was at
hand, and that all good Mussulmen would shortly be going to prayer. So he
hastened his steps lest he should meet some one on his way to the mosque, who,
seeing his condition, would send him to prison as a drunkard. In his haste he
jostled against the hunchback, who fell heavily upon him, and the merchant,
thinking he was being attacked by a thief, knocked him down with one blow of
his fist. He then called loudly for help, beating the fallen man all the while.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The chief policeman of
the quarter came running up, and found a Christian ill-treating a Mussulman.
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked indignantly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He tried to rob
me,&quot; replied the merchant, &quot;and very nearly choked me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, you have had
your revenge,&quot; said the man, catching hold of his arm. &quot;Come, be off
with you!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he spoke he held out
his hand to the hunchback to help him up, but the hunchback never moved.
&quot;Oho!&quot; he went on, looking closer, &quot;so this is the way a
Christian has the impudence to treat a Mussulman!&quot; and seizing the
merchant in a firm grasp he took him to the inspector of police, who threw him
into prison till the judge should be out of bed and ready to attend to his
case. All this brought the merchant to his senses, but the more he thought of
it the less he could understand how the hunchback could have died merely from
the blows he had received. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant was still
pondering on this subject when he was summoned before the chief of police and
questioned about his crime, which he could not deny. As the hunchback was one
of the Sultan's private jesters, the chief of police resolved to defer sentence
of death until he had consulted his master. He went to the palace to demand an
audience, and told his story to the Sultan, who only answered, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;There is no pardon
for a Christian who kills a Mussulman. Do your duty.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the chief of police
ordered a gallows to be erected, and sent criers to proclaim in every street in
the city that a Christian was to be hanged that day for having killed a
Mussulman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When all was ready the
merchant was brought from prison and led to the foot of the gallows. The
executioner knotted the cord firmly round the unfortunate man's neck and was
just about to swing him into the air, when the Sultan's purveyor dashed through
the crowd, and cried, panting, to the hangman, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Stop, stop, don't
be in such a hurry. It was not he who did the murder, it was I.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The chief of police, who
was present to see that everything was in order, put several questions to the
purveyor, who told him the whole story of the death of the hunchback, and how
he had carried the body to the place where it had been found by the Christian
merchant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are
going,&quot; he said to the chief of police, &quot;to kill an innocent man, for
it is impossible that he should have murdered a creature who was dead already.
It is bad enough for me to have slain a Mussulman without having it on my
conscience that a Christian who is guiltless should suffer through my
fault.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the purveyor's
speech had been made in a loud voice, and was heard by all the crowd, and even
if he had wished it, the chief of police could not have escaped setting the
merchant free. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Loose the cords
from the Christian's neck,&quot; he commanded, turning to the executioner,
&quot;and hang this man in his place, seeing that by his own confession he is
the murderer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The hangman did as he
was bid, and was tying the cord firmly, when he was stopped by the voice of the
Jewish doctor beseeching him to pause, for he had something very important to
say. When he had fought his way through the crowd and reached the chief of
police, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Worshipful
sir,&quot; he began, &quot;this Mussulman whom you desire to hang is unworthy
of death; I alone am guilty. Last night a man and a woman who were strangers to
me knocked at my door, bringing with them a patient for me to cure. The servant
opened it, but having no light was hardly able to make out their faces, though
she readily agreed to wake me and to hand me the fee for my services. While she
was telling me her story they seem to have carried the sick man to the top of
the staircase and then left him there. I jumped up in a hurry without waiting
for a lantern, and in the darkness I fell against something, which tumbled
headlong down the stairs and never stopped till it reached the bottom. When I
examined the body I found it was quite dead, and the corpse was that of a
hunchback Mussulman. Terrified at what we had done, my wife and I took the body
on the roof and let it down the chimney of our neighbour the purveyor, whom you
were just about to hang. The purveyor, finding him in his room, naturally
thought he was a thief, and struck him such a blow that the man fell down and
lay motionless on the floor. Stooping to examine him, and finding him stone
dead, the purveyor supposed that the man had died from the blow he had
received; but of course this was a mistake, as you will see from my account,
and I only am the murderer; and although I am innocent of any wish to commit a
crime, I must suffer for it all the same, or else have the blood of two
Musselmans on my conscience. Therefore send away this man, I pray you, and let
me take his place, as it is I who am guilty.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On hearing the
declaration of the Jewish doctor, the chief of police commanded that he should
be led to the gallows, and the Sultan's purveyor go free. The cord was placed
round the Jew's neck, and his feet had already ceased to touch the ground when
the voice of the tailor was heard beseeching the executioner to pause one
moment and to listen to what he had to say. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, my lord,&quot;
he cried, turning to the chief of police, &quot;how nearly have you caused the
death of three innocent people! But if you will only have the patience to
listen to my tale, you shall know who is the real culprit. If some one has to
suffer, it must be me! Yesterday, at dusk, I was working in my shop with a
light heart when the little hunchback, who was more than half drunk, came and
sat in the doorway. He sang me several songs, and then I invited him to finish
the evening at my house. He accepted my invitation, and we went away together.
At supper I helped him to a slice of fish, but in eating it a bone stuck in his
throat, and in spite of all we could do he died in a few minutes. We felt
deeply sorry for his death, but fearing lest we should be held responsible, we
carried the corpse to the house of the Jewish doctor. I knocked, and desired
the servant to beg her master to come down as fast as possible and see a sick
man whom we had brought for him to cure; and in order to hasten his movements I
placed a piece of money in her hand as the doctor's fee. Directly she had
disappeared I dragged the body to the top of the stairs, and then hurried away
with my wife back to our house. In descending the stairs the doctor
accidentally knocked over the corpse, and finding him dead believed that he
himself was the murderer. But now you know the truth set him free, and let me
die in his stead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The chief of police and
the crowd of spectators were lost in astonishment at the strange events to
which the death of the hunchback had given rise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Loosen the Jewish
doctor,&quot; said he to the hangman, &quot;and string up the tailor instead,
since he has made confession of his crime. Really, one cannot deny that this is
a very singular story, and it deserves to be written in letters of gold.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The executioner speedily
untied the knots which confined the doctor, and was passing the cord round the
neck of the tailor, when the Sultan of Kashgar, who had missed his jester,
happened to make inquiry of his officers as to what had become of him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot;
replied they, &quot;the hunchback having drunk more than was good for him,
escaped from the palace and was seen wandering about the town, where this
morning he was found dead. A man was arrested for having caused his death, and
held in custody till a gallows was erected. At the moment that he was about to
suffer punishment, first one man arrived, and then another, each accusing
themselves of the murder, and this went on for a long time, and at the present
instant the chief of police is engaged in questioning a man who declares that
he alone is the true assassin.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan of Kashgar no
sooner heard these words than he ordered an usher to go to the chief of police
and to bring all the persons concerned in the hunchback's death, together with the
corpse, that he wished to see once again. The usher hastened on his errand, but
was only just in time, for the tailor was positively swinging in the air, when
his voice fell upon the silence of the crowd, commanding the hangman to cut
down the body. The hangman, recognising the usher as one of the king's
servants, cut down the tailor, and the usher, seeing the man was safe, sought
the chief of police and gave him the Sultan's message. Accordingly, the chief
of police at once set out for the palace, taking with him the tailor, the
doctor, the purveyor, and the merchant, who bore the dead hunchback on their
shoulders. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the procession
reached the palace the chief of police prostrated himself at the feet of the
Sultan, and related all that he knew of the matter. The Sultan was so much
struck by the circumstances that he ordered his private historian to write down
an exact account of what had passed, so that in the years to come the
miraculous escape of the four men who had thought themselves murderers might
never be forgotten. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan asked
everybody concerned in the hunchback's affair to tell him their stories. Among
others was a prating barber, whose tale of one of his brothers follows. </span></p>

Brother</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As long as our father
lived Alnaschar was very idle. Instead of working for his bread he was not
ashamed to ask for it every evening, and to support himself next day on what he
had received the night before. When our father died, worn out by age, he only
left seven hundred silver drachmas to be divided amongst us, which made one
hundred for each son. Alnaschar, who had never possessed so much money in his
life, was quite puzzled to know what to do with it. After reflecting upon the
matter for some time he decided to lay it out on glasses, bottles, and things of
that sort, which he would buy from a wholesale merchant. Having bought his
stock he next proceeded to look out for a small shop in a good position, where
he sat down at the open door, his wares being piled up in an uncovered basket
in front of him, waiting for a customer among the passers-by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In this attitude he
remained seated, his eyes fixed on the basket, but his thoughts far away.
Unknown to himself he began to talk out loud, and a tailor, whose shop was next
door to his, heard quite plainly what he was saying. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This basket,&quot;
said Alnaschar to himself, &quot;has cost me a hundred drachmas--all that I
possess in the world. Now in selling the contents piece by piece I shall turn
two hundred, and these hundreds I shall again lay out in glass, which will produce
four hundred. By this means I shall in course of time make four thousand
drachmas, which will easily double themselves. When I have got ten thousand I
will give up the glass trade and become a jeweller, and devote all my time to
trading in pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones. At last, having all the
wealth that heart can desire, I will buy a beautiful country house, with horses
and slaves, and then I will lead a merry life and entertain my friends. At my
feasts I will send for musicians and dancers from the neighbouring town to
amuse my guests. In spite of my riches I shall not, however, give up trade till
I have amassed a capital of a hundred thousand drachmas, when, having become a
man of much consideration, I shall request the hand of the grand-vizir's
daughter, taking care to inform the worthy father that I have heard favourable
reports of her beauty and wit, and that I will pay down on our wedding day 3
thousand gold pieces. Should the vizir refuse my proposal, which after all is
hardly to be expected, I will seize him by the beard and drag him to my
house.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When I shall have
married his daughter I will give her ten of the best eunuchs that can be found
for her service. Then I shall put on my most gorgeous robes, and mounted on a
horse with a saddle of fine gold, and its trappings blazing with diamonds,
followed by a train of slaves, I shall present myself at the house of the
grand-vizir, the people casting down their eyes and bowing low as I pass along.
At the foot of the grand-vizir's staircase I shall dismount, and while my
servants stand in a row to right and left I shall ascend the stairs, at the
head of which the grand-vizir will be waiting to receive me. He will then
embrace me as his son-in-law, and giving me his seat will place himself below
me. This being done (as I have every reason to expect), two of my servants will
enter, each bearing a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold. One of these
I shall present to him saying, &quot;Here are the thousand gold pieces that I
offered for your daughter's hand, and here,&quot; I shall continue, holding out
the second purse, &quot;are another thousand to show you that I am a man who is
better than his word.&quot; After hearing of such generosity the world will
talk of nothing else. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I shall return home with
the same pomp as I set out, and my wife will send an officer to compliment me
on my visit to her father, and I shall confer on the officer the honour of a
rich dress and a handsome gift. Should she send one to me I shall refuse it and
dismiss the bearer. I shall never allow my wife to leave her rooms on any
pretext whatever without my permission, and my visits to her will be marked by
all the ceremony calculated to inspire respect. No establishment will be better
ordered than mine, and I shall take care always to be dressed in a manner
suitable to my position. In the evening, when we retire to our apartments, I
shall sit in the place of honour, where I shall assume a grand demeanour and
speak little, gazing straight before me, and when my wife, lovely as the full
moon, stands humbly in front of my chair I shall pretend not to see her. Then
her women will say to me, &quot;Respected lord and master, your wife and slave
is before you waiting to be noticed. She is mortified that you never deign to
look her way; she is tired of standing so long. Beg her, we pray you, to be
seated.&quot; Of course I shall give no signs of even hearing this speech,
which will vex them mightily. They will throw themselves at my feet with
lamentations, and at length I will raise my head and throw a careless glance at
her, then I shall go back to my former attitude. The women will think that I am
displeased at my wife's dress and will lead her away to put on a finer one, and
I on my side shall replace the one I am wearing with another yet more splendid.
They will then return to the charge, but this time it will take much longer
before they persuade me even to look at my wife. It is as well to begin on my
wedding-day as I mean to go on for the rest of our lives. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day she will
complain to her mother of the way she has been treated, which will fill my
heart with joy. Her mother will come to seek me, and, kissing my hands with
respect, will say, &quot;My lord&quot; (for she could not dare to risk my anger
by using the familiar title of &quot;son-in-law&quot;), &quot;My lord, do not,
I implore you, refuse to look upon my daughter or to approach her. She only
lives to please you, and loves you with all her soul.&quot; But I shall pay no
more heed to my mother-in-law's words than I did to those of the women. Again
she will beseech me to listen to her entreaties, throwing herself this time at
my feet, but all to no purpose. Then, putting a glass of wine into my wife's
hand, she will say to her, &quot;There, present that to him yourself, he cannot
have the cruelty to reject anything offered by so beautiful a hand,&quot; and
my wife will take it and offer it to me tremblingly with tears in her eyes, but
I shall look in the other direction. This will cause her to weep still more,
and she will hold out the glass crying, &quot;Adorable husband, never shall I
cease my prayers till you have done me the favour to drink.&quot; Sick of her
importunities, these words will goad me to fury. I shall dart an angry look at
her and give her a sharp blow on the cheek, at the same time giving her a kick
so violent that she will stagger across the room and fall on to the sofa. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother,&quot;
pursued the barber, &quot;was so much absorbed in his dreams that he actually
did give a kick with his foot, which unluckily hit the basket of glass. It fell
into the street and was instantly broken into a thousand pieces.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His neighbour the
tailor, who had been listening to his visions, broke into a loud fit of
laughter as he saw this sight. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wretched
man!&quot; he cried, &quot;you ought to die of shame at behaving so to a young
wife who has done nothing to you. You must be a brute for her tears and prayers
not to touch your heart. If I were the grand-vizir I would order you a hundred
blows from a bullock whip, and would have you led round the town accompanied by
a herald who should proclaim your crimes.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The accident, so fatal
to all his profits, had restored my brother to his senses, and seeing that the
mischief had been caused by his own insufferable pride, he rent his clothes and
tore his hair, and lamented himself so loudly that the passers-by stopped to
listen. It was a Friday, so these were more numerous than usual. Some pitied
Alnaschar, others only laughed at him, but the vanity which had gone to his
head had disappeared with his basket of glass, and he was loudly bewailing his
folly when a lady, evidently a person of consideration, rode by on a mule. She
stopped and inquired what was the matter, and why the man wept. They told her
that he was a poor man who had laid out all his money on this basket of glass,
which was now broken. On hearing the cause of these loud wails the lady turned
to her attendant and said to him, &quot;Give him whatever you have got with
you.&quot; The man obeyed, and placed in my brother's hands a purse containing
five hundred pieces of gold. Alnaschar almost died of joy on receiving it. He
blessed the lady a thousand times, and, shutting up his shop where he had no
longer anything to do, he returned home. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was still absorbed in
contemplating his good fortune, when a knock came to his door, and on opening
it he found an old woman standing outside. </span></p>

style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son,&quot; she
said, &quot;I have a favour to ask of you. It is the hour of prayer and I have
not yet washed myself. Let me, I beg you, enter your house, and give me
water.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My brother, although the
old woman was a stranger to him, did not hesitate to do as she wished. He gave
her a vessel of water and then went back to his place and his thoughts, and
with his mind busy over his last adventure, he put his gold into a long and
narrow purse, which he could easily carry in his belt. During this time the old
woman was busy over her prayers, and when she had finished she came and
prostrated herself twice before my brother, and then rising called down endless
blessings on his head. Observing her shabby clothes, my brother thought that
her gratitude was in reality a hint that he should give her some money to buy
some new ones, so he held out two pieces of gold. The old woman started back in
surprise as if she had received an insult. &quot;Good heavens!&quot; she
exclaimed, &quot;what is the meaning of this? Is it possible that you take me,
my lord, for one of those miserable creatures who force their way into houses
to beg for alms? Take back your money. I am thankful to say I do not need it,
for I belong to a beautiful lady who is very rich and gives me everything I
want.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My brother was not
clever enough to detect that the old woman had merely refused the two pieces of
money he had offered her in order to get more, but he inquired if she could
procure him the pleasure of seeing this lady. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Willingly,&quot;
she replied; &quot;and she will be charmed to marry you, and to make you the

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Delighted at the thought
that he had found so easily both a fortune and a beautiful wife, my brother
asked no more questions, but concealing his purse, with the money the lady had
given him, in the folds of his dress, he set out joyfully with his guide. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They walked for some
distance till the old woman stopped at a large house, where she knocked. The
door was opened by a young Greek slave, and the old woman led my brother across
a well-paved court into a well-furnished hall. Here she left him to inform her
mistress of his presence, and as the day was hot he flung himself on a pile of
cushions and took off his heavy turban. In a few minutes there entered a lady,
and my brother perceived at the first glance that she was even more beautiful
and more richly dressed than he had expected. He rose from his seat, but the
lady signed to him to sit down again and placed herself beside him. After the
usual compliments had passed between them she said, &quot;We are not
comfortable here, let us go into another room,&quot; and passing into a smaller
chamber, apparently communicating with no other, she continued to talk to him
for some time. Then rising hastily she left him, saying, &quot;Stay where you
are, I will come back in a moment.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He waited as he was
told, but instead of the lady there entered a huge black slave with a sword in
his hand. Approaching my brother with an angry countenance he exclaimed,
&quot;What business have you here?&quot; His voice and manner were so terrific
that Alnaschar had not strength to reply, and allowed his gold to be taken from
him, and even sabre cuts to be inflicted on him without making any resistance.
As soon as he was let go, he sank on the ground powerless to move, though he
still had possession of his senses. Thinking he was dead, the black ordered the
Greek slave to bring him some salt, and between them they rubbed it into his
wounds, thus giving him acute agony, though he had the presence of mind to give
no sign of life. They then left him, and their place was taken by the old
woman, who dragged him to a trapdoor and threw him down into a vault filled
with the bodies of murdered men. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At first the violence of
his fall caused him to lose consciousness, but luckily the salt which had been
rubbed into his wounds had by its smarting preserved his life, and little by
little he regained his strength. At the end of two days he lifted the trapdoor
during the night and hid himself in the courtyard till daybreak, when he saw
the old woman leave the house in search of more prey. Luckily she did not
observe him, and when she was out of sight he stole from this nest of assassins
and took refuge in my house. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I dressed his wounds and
tended him carefully, and when a month had passed he was as well as ever. His
one thought was how to be revenged on that wicked old hag, and for this purpose
he had a purse made large enough to contain five hundred gold pieces, but
filled it instead with bits of glass. This he tied round him with his sash,
and, disguising himself as an old woman, he took a sabre, which he hid under
his dress. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One morning as he was
hobbling through the streets he met his old enemy prowling to see if she could
find anyone to decoy. He went up to her and, imitating the voice of a woman, he
said, &quot;Do you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me? I have
just come from Persia and have brought with me five hundred gold pieces, and I
am anxious to see if they are the proper weight.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good woman,&quot;
replied the old hag, &quot;you could not have asked anyone better. My son is a
money-changer, and if you will follow me he will weigh them for you himself.
Only we must be quick or he will have gone to his shop.&quot; So saying she led
the way to the same house as before, and the door was opened by the same Greek
slave. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Again my brother was
left in the hall, and the pretended son appeared under the form of the black
slave. &quot;Miserable crone,&quot; he said to my brother, &quot;get up and
come with me,&quot; and turned to lead the way to the place of murder.
Alnaschar rose too, and drawing the sabre from under his dress dealt the black
such a blow on his neck that his head was severed from his body. My brother
picked up the head with one hand, and seizing the body with the other dragged
it to the vault, when he threw it in and sent the head after it. The Greek
slave, supposing that all had passed as usual, shortly arrived with the basin
of salt, but when she beheld Alnaschar with the sabre in his hand she let the
basin fall and turned to fly. My brother, however, was too quick for her, and
in another instant her head was rolling from her shoulders. The noise brought
the old woman running to see what was the matter, and he seized her before she
had time to escape. &quot;Wretch!&quot; he cried, &quot;do you know me?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who are you, my
lord?&quot; she replied trembling all over. &quot;I have never seen you
before.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am he whose
house you entered to offer your hypocritical prayers. Don't you remember
now?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She flung herself on her
knees to implore mercy, but he cut her in four pieces. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There remained only the
lady, who was quite ignorant of all that was taking place around her. He sought
her through the house, and when at last he found her, she nearly fainted with
terror at the sight of him. She begged hard for life, which he was generous
enough to give her, but he bade her to tell him how she had got into
partnership with the abominable creatures he had just put to death. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I was once,&quot;
replied she, &quot;the wife of an honest merchant, and that old woman, whose
wickedness I did not know, used occasionally to visit me. 'Madam,' she said to
me one day, 'we have a grand wedding at our house to-day. If you would do us
the honour to be present, I am sure you would enjoy yourself.' I allowed myself
to be persuaded, put on my richest dress, and took a purse with a hundred
pieces of gold. Once inside the doors I was kept by force by that dreadful
black, and it is now three years that I have been here, to my great grief.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That horrible
black must have amassed great wealth,&quot; remarked my brother. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Such wealth,&quot;
returned she, &quot;that if you succeed in carrying it all away it will make
you rich for ever. Come and let us see how much there is.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She led Alnaschar into a
chamber filled with coffers packed with gold, which he gazed at with an
admiration he was powerless to conceal. &quot;Go,&quot; she said, &quot;and
bring men to carry them away.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My brother did not wait
to be told twice, and hurried out into the streets, where he soon collected ten
men. They all came back to the house, but what was his surprise to find the
door open, and the room with the chests of gold quite empty. The lady had been
cleverer than himself, and had made the best use of her time. However, he tried
to console himself by removing all the beautiful furniture, which more than
made up for the five hundred gold pieces he had lost. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Unluckily, on leaving
the house, he forgot to lock the door, and the neighbours, finding the place
empty, informed the police, who next morning arrested Alnaschar as a thief. My
brother tried to bribe them to let him off, but far from listening to him they
tied his hands, and forced him to walk between them to the presence of the
judge. When they had explained to the official the cause of complaint, he asked
Alnaschar where he had obtained all the furniture that he had taken to his
house the day before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir,&quot; replied
Alnaschar, &quot;I am ready to tell you the whole story, but give, I pray you,
your word, that I shall run no risk of punishment.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That I
promise,&quot; said the judge. So my brother began at the beginning and related
all his adventures, and how he had avenged himself on those who had betrayed
him. As to the furniture, he entreated the judge at least to allow him to keep
part to make up for the five hundred pieces of gold which had been stolen from
him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The judge, however,
would say nothing about this, and lost no time in sending men to fetch away all
that Alnaschar had taken from the house. When everything had been moved and
placed under his roof he ordered my brother to leave the town and never more to
enter it on peril of his life, fearing that if he returned he might seek
justice from the Caliph. Alnaschar obeyed, and was on his way to a neighbouring
city when he fell in with a band of robbers, who stripped him of his clothes
and left him naked by the roadside. Hearing of his plight, I hurried after him
to console him for his misfortunes, and to dress him in my best robe. I then
brought him back disguised, under cover of night, to my house, where I have
since given him all the care I bestow on my other brothers. </span></p>
