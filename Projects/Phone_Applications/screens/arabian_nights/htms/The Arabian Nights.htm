<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%'>The Arabian Nights</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the chronicles of the ancient dynasty of the
Sassanidae, who reigned for about four hundred years, from Persia to the
borders of China, beyond the great river Ganges itself, we read the praises of
one of the kings of this race, who was said to be the best monarch of his time.
His subjects loved him, and his neighbors feared him, and when he died he left
his kingdom in a more prosperous and powerful condition than any king had done
before him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two sons who survived him loved each other
tenderly, and it was a real grief to the elder, Schahriar, that the laws of the
empire forbade him to share his dominions with his brother Schahzeman. Indeed,
after ten years, during which this state of things had not ceased to trouble
him, Schahriar cut off the country of Great Tartary from the Persian Empire and
made his brother king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the Sultan Schahriar had a wife whom he
loved more than all the world, and his greatest happiness was to surround her
with splendour, and to give her the finest dresses and the most beautiful
jewels. It was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that he accidentally
discovered, after several years, that she had deceived him completely, and her
whole conduct turned out to have been so bad, that he felt himself obliged to
carry out the law of the land, and order the grand-vizir to put her to death.
The blow was so heavy that his mind almost gave way, and he declared that he
was quite sure that at bottom all women were as wicked as the sultana, if you
could only find them out, and that the fewer the world contained the better. So
every evening he married a fresh wife and had her strangled the following
morning before the grand-vizir, whose duty it was to provide these unhappy
brides for the Sultan. The poor man fulfilled his task with reluctance, but
there was no escape, and every day saw a girl married and a wife dead. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This behaviour caused the greatest horror in the
town, where nothing was heard but cries and lamentations. In one house was a
father weeping for the loss of his daughter, in another perhaps a mother
trembling for the fate of her child; and instead of the blessings that had
formerly been heaped on the Sultan's head, the air was now full of curses. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir himself was the father of two
daughters, of whom the elder was called Scheherazade, and the younger
Dinarzade. Dinarzade had no particular gifts to distinguish her from other
girls, but her sister was clever and courageous in the highest degree. Her
father had given her the best masters in philosophy, medicine, history and the
fine arts, and besides all this, her beauty excelled that of any girl in the
kingdom of Persia. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day, when the grand-vizir was talking to his
eldest daughter, who was his delight and pride, Scheherazade said to him,
&quot;Father, I have a favour to ask of you. Will you grant it to me?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I can refuse you nothing,&quot; replied
he, &quot;that is just and reasonable.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then listen,&quot; said Scheherazade.
&quot;I am determined to stop this barbarous practice of the Sultan's, and to
deliver the girls and mothers from the awful fate that hangs over them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It would be an excellent thing to
do,&quot; returned the grand-vizir, &quot;but how do you propose to accomplish
it?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My father,&quot; answered Scheherazade,
&quot;it is you who have to provide the Sultan daily with a fresh wife, and I
implore you, by all the affection you bear me, to allow the honour to fall upon
me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have you lost your senses?&quot; cried the
grand-vizir, starting back in horror. &quot;What has put such a thing into your
head? You ought to know by this time what it means to be the sultan's
bride!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my father, I know it well,&quot;
replied she, &quot;and I am not afraid to think of it. If I fail, my death will
be a glorious one, and if I succeed I shall have done a great service to my
country.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is of no use,&quot; said the
grand-vizir, &quot;I shall never consent. If the Sultan was to order me to
plunge a dagger in your heart, I should have to obey. What a task for a father!
Ah, if you do not fear death, fear at any rate the anguish you would cause
me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Once again, my father,&quot; said
Scheherazade, &quot;will you grant me what I ask?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What, are you still so obstinate?&quot;
exclaimed the grand-vizir. &quot;Why are you so resolved upon your own
ruin?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the maiden absolutely refused to attend to
her father's words, and at length, in despair, the grand-vizir was obliged to
give way, and went sadly to the palace to tell the Sultan that the following
evening he would bring him Scheherazade. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan received this news with the greatest
astonishment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How have you made up your mind,&quot; he
asked, &quot;to sacrifice your own daughter to me?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the grand-vizir,
&quot;it is her own wish. Even the sad fate that awaits her could not hold her
back.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let there be no mistake, vizir,&quot; said
the Sultan. &quot;Remember you will have to take her life yourself. If you
refuse, I swear that your head shall pay forfeit.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; returned the vizir.
&quot;Whatever the cost, I will obey you. Though a father, I am also your
subject.&quot; So the Sultan told the grand-vizir he might bring his daughter
as soon as he liked. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir took back this news to Scheherazade,
who received it as if it had been the most pleasant thing in the world. She
thanked her father warmly for yielding to her wishes, and, seeing him still
bowed down with grief, told him that she hoped he would never repent having
allowed her to marry the Sultan. Then she went to prepare herself for the
marriage, and begged that her sister Dinarzade should be sent for to speak to
her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they were alone, Scheherazade addressed her
thus: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My dear sister; I want your help in a very
important affair. My father is going to take me to the palace to celebrate my
marriage with the Sultan. When his Highness receives me, I shall beg him, as a
last favour, to let you sleep in our chamber, so that I may have your company
during the last night I am alive. If, as I hope, he grants me my wish, be sure
that you wake me an hour before the dawn, and speak to me in these words: 'My
sister, if you are not asleep, I beg you, before the sun rises, to tell me one
of your charming stories.' Then I shall begin, and I hope by this means to
deliver the people from the terror that reigns over them.&quot; Dinarzade
replied that she would do with pleasure what her sister wished. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the usual hour arrived the grand-vizir
conducted Scheherazade to the palace, and left her alone with the Sultan, who
bade her raise her veil and was amazed at her beauty. But seeing her eyes full
of tears, he asked what was the matter. &quot;Sire,&quot; replied Scheherazade,
&quot;I have a sister who loves me as tenderly as I love her. Grant me the
favour of allowing her to sleep this night in the same room, as it is the last
we shall be together.&quot; Schahriar consented to Scheherazade's petition and
Dinarzade was sent for. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>An hour before daybreak Dinarzade awoke, and
exclaimed, as she had promised, &quot;My dear sister, if you are not asleep,
tell me I pray you, before the sun rises, one of your charming stories. It is
the last time that I shall have the pleasure of hearing you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scheherazade did not answer her sister, but
turned to the Sultan. &quot;Will your highness permit me to do as my sister
asks?&quot; said she. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Willingly,&quot; he answered. So
Scheherazade began. </span></p>
