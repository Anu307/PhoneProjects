<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%'>The Story of the Barber's Sixth
Brother</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There now remains for me to relate to you the
story of my sixth brother, whose name was Schacabac. Like the rest of us, he
inherited a hundred silver drachmas from our father, which he thought was a
large fortune, but through ill-luck, he soon lost it all, and was driven to
beg. As he had a smooth tongue and good manners, he really did very well in his
new profession, and he devoted himself specially to making friends with the
servants in big houses, so as to gain access to their masters. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with
a crowd of servants lounging in the courtyard. He thought that from the
appearance of the house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he entered and
inquired to whom it belonged. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My good man, where do you come from?&quot;
replied the servant. &quot;Can't you see for yourself that it can belong to
nobody but a Barmecide?&quot; for the Barmecides were famed for their
liberality and generosity. My brother, hearing this, asked the porters, of whom
there were several, if they would give him alms. They did not refuse, but told
him politely to go in, and speak to the master himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My brother thanked them for their courtesy and
entered the building, which was so large that it took him some time to reach
the apartments of the Barmecide. At last, in a room richly decorated with
paintings, he saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting on a sofa, who
received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldened to make his
petition. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; he said, &quot;you behold
in me a poor man who only lives by the help of persons as rich and as generous
as you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before he could proceed further, he was stopped
by the astonishment shown by the Barmecide. &quot;Is it possible,&quot; he
cried, &quot;that while I am in Bagdad, a man like you should be starving? That
is a state of things that must at once be put an end to! Never shall it be said
that I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you, on your part, will never
abandon me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; answered my brother,
&quot;I swear that I have not broken my fast this whole day.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What, you are dying of hunger?&quot;
exclaimed the Barmecide. &quot;Here, slave; bring water, that we may wash our
hands before meat!&quot; No slave appeared, but my brother remarked that the
Barmecide did not fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over
them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he said to my brother, &quot;Why don't you
wash your hands too?&quot; and Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the
part of the Barmecide (though he could see none himself), drew near, and
imitated his motion. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Barmecide had done rubbing his hands,
he raised his voice, and cried, &quot;Set food before us at once, we are very
hungry.&quot; No food was brought, but the Barmecide pretended to help himself
from a dish, and carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so, &quot;Eat,
my friend, eat, I entreat. Help yourself as freely as if you were at home! For
a starving man, you seem to have a very small appetite.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Excuse me, my lord,&quot; replied Schacabac,
imitating his gestures as before, &quot;I really am not losing time, and I do
full justice to the repast.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How do you like this bread?&quot; asked
the Barmecide. &quot;I find it particularly good myself.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, my lord,&quot; answered my brother,
who beheld neither meat nor bread, &quot;never have I tasted anything so
delicious.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Eat as much as you want,&quot; said the
Barmecide. &quot;I bought the woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of
gold, so that I might never be without it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After ordering a variety of dishes (which never
came) to be placed on the table, and discussing the merits of each one, the
Barmecide declared that having dined so well, they would now proceed to take
their wine. To this my brother at first objected, declaring that it was
forbidden; but on the Barmecide insisting that it was out of the question that
he should drink by himself, he consented to take a little. The Barmecide,
however, pretended to fill their glasses so often, that my brother feigned that
the wine had gone into his head, and struck the Barmecide such a blow on the
head, that he fell to the ground. Indeed, he raised his hand to strike him a
second time, when the Barmecide cried out that he was mad, upon which my
brother controlled himself, and apologised and protested that it was all the
fault of the wine he had drunk. At this the Barmecide, instead of being angry,
began to laugh, and embraced him heartily. &quot;I have long been
seeking,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;a man of your description, and henceforth my
house shall be yours. You have had the good grace to fall in with my humour,
and to pretend to eat and to drink when nothing was there. Now you shall be
rewarded by a really good supper.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he clapped his hands, and all the dishes
were brought that they had tasted in imagination before and during the repast,
slaves sang and played on various instruments. All the while Schacabac was
treated by the Barmecide as a familiar friend, and dressed in a garment out of
his own wardrobe. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Twenty years passed by, and my brother was still
living with the Barmecide, looking after his house, and managing his affairs.
At the end of that time his generous benefactor died without heirs, so all his
possessions went to the prince. They even despoiled my brother of those that
rightly belonged to him, and he, now as poor as he had ever been in his life,
decided to cast in his lot with a caravan of pilgrims who were on their way to
Mecca. Unluckily, the caravan was attacked and pillaged by the Bedouins, and
the pilgrims were taken prisoners. My brother became the slave of a man who
beat him daily, hoping to drive him to offer a ransom, although, as Schacabac
pointed out, it was quite useless trouble, as his relations were as poor as
himself. At length the Bedouin grew tired of tormenting, and sent him on a
camel to the top of a high barren mountain, where he left him to take his
chance. A passing caravan, on its way to Bagdad, told me where he was to be
found, and I hurried to his rescue, and brought him in a deplorable condition
back to the town. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This,&quot;--continued the barber,--&quot;is
the tale I related to the Caliph, who, when I had finished, burst into fits of
laughter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well were you called `the Silent,'&quot;
said he; &quot;no name was ever better deserved. But for reasons of my own,
which it is not necessary to mention, I desire you to leave the town, and never
to come back.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I had of course no choice but to obey, and
travelled about for several years until I heard of the death of the Caliph,
when I hastily returned to Bagdad, only to find that all my brothers were dead.
It was at this time that I rendered to the young cripple the important service
of which you have heard, and for which, as you know, he showed such profound
ingratitude, that he preferred rather to leave Bagdad than to run the risk of
seeing me. I sought him long from place to place, but it was only to-day, when
I expected it least, that I came across him, as much irritated with me as
ever&quot;-- So saying the tailor went on to relate the story of the lame man
and the barber, which has already been told. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When the barber,&quot; he continued,
&quot;had finished his tale, we came to the conclusion that the young man had
been right, when he had accused him of being a great chatter-box. However, we
wished to keep him with us, and share our feast, and we remained at table till
the hour of afternoon prayer. Then the company broke up, and I went back to
work in my shop. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It was during this interval that the
little hunchback, half drunk already, presented himself before me, singing and
playing on his drum. I took him home, to amuse my wife, and she invited him to
supper. While eating some fish, a bone got into his throat, and in spite of all
we could do, he died shortly. It was all so sudden that we lost our heads, and
in order to divert suspicion from ourselves, we carried the body to the house
of a Jewish physician. He placed it in the chamber of the purveyor, and the
purveyor propped it up in the street, where it was thought to have been killed
by the merchant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This, Sire, is the story which I was
obliged to tell to satisfy your highness. It is now for you to say if we
deserve mercy or punishment; life or death?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan of Kashgar listened with an air of
pleasure which filled the tailor and his friends with hope. &quot;I must
confess,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;that I am much more interested in the stories
of the barber and his brothers, and of the lame man, than in that of my own
jester. But before I allow you all four to return to your own homes, and have
the corpse of the hunchback properly buried, I should like to see this barber
who has earned your pardon. And as he is in this town, let an usher go with you
at once in search of him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The usher and the tailor soon returned, bringing
with them an old man who must have been at least ninety years of age. &quot;O
Silent One,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;I am told that you know many strange
stories. Will you tell some of them to me?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Never mind my stories for the
present,&quot; replied the barber, &quot;but will your Highness graciously be
pleased to explain why this Jew, this Christian, and this Mussulman, as well as
this dead body, are all here?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What business is that of yours?&quot;
asked the Sultan with a smile; but seeing that the barber had some reasons for
his question, he commanded that the tale of the hunchback should be told him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is certainly most surprising,&quot;
cried he, when he had heard it all, &quot;but I should like to examine the
body.&quot; He then knelt down, and took the head on his knees, looking at it
attentively. Suddenly he burst into such loud laughter that he fell right
backwards, and when he had recovered himself enough to speak, he turned to the
Sultan. &quot;The man is no more dead than I am,&quot; he said; &quot;watch
me.&quot; As he spoke he drew a small case of medicines from his pocket and
rubbed the neck of the hunchback with some ointment made of balsam. Next he
opened the dead man's mouth, and by the help of a pair of pincers drew the bone
from his throat. At this the hunchback sneezed, stretched himself and opened
his eyes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan and all those who saw this operation
did not know which to admire most, the constitution of the hunchback who had
apparently been dead for a whole night and most of one day, or the skill of the
barber, whom everyone now began to look upon as a great man. His Highness
desired that the history of the hunchback should be written down, and placed in
the archives beside that of the barber, so that they might be associated in
people's minds to the end of time. And he did not stop there; for in order to
wipe out the memory of what they had undergone, he commanded that the tailor, the
doctor, the purveyor and the merchant, should each be clothed in his presence
with a robe from his own wardrobe before they returned home. As for the barber,
he bestowed on him a large pension, and kept him near his own person. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some twenty days' sail from the coast of Persia
lies the isle of the children of Khaledan. The island is divided into several
provinces, in each of which are large flourishing towns, and the whole forms an
important kingdom. It was governed in former days by a king named Schahzaman,
who, with good right, considered himself one of the most peaceful, prosperous,
and fortunate monarchs on the earth. In fact, he had but one grievance, which
was that none of his four wives had given him an heir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This distressed him so greatly that one day he
confided his grief to the grand-vizir, who, being a wise counsellor, said:
&quot;Such matters are indeed beyond human aid. Allah alone can grant your
desire, and I should advise you, sire, to send large gifts to those holy men
who spend their lives in prayer, and to beg for their intercessions. Who knows
whether their petitions may not be answered!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king took his vizir's advice, and the result
of so many prayers for an heir to the throne was that a son was born to him the
following year. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Schahzaman sent noble gifts as thank offerings
to all the mosques and religious houses, and great rejoicings were celebrated
in honour of the birth of the little prince, who was so beautiful that he was
named Camaralzaman, or &quot;Moon of the Century.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Camaralzaman was brought up with extreme
care by an excellent governor and all the cleverest teachers, and he did such
credit to them that when he was grown up, a more charming and accomplished young
man was not to be found. Whilst he was still a youth the king, his father, who
loved him dearly, had some thoughts of abdicating in his favour. As usual he
talked over his plans with his grand-vizir, who, though he did not approve the
idea, would not state all his objections. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; he replied, &quot;the prince
is still very young for the cares of state. Your Majesty fears his growing idle
and careless, and doubtless you are right. But how would it be if he were first
to marry? This would attach him to his home, and your Majesty might give him a
share in your counsels, so that he might gradually learn how to wear a crown,
which you can give up to him whenever you find him capable of wearing it.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir's advice once more struck the king as
being good, and he sent for his son, who lost no time in obeying the summons,
and standing respectfully with downcast eyes before the king asked for his
commands. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have sent for you,&quot; said the king,
&quot;to say that I wish you to marry. What do you think about it?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince was so much overcome by these words
that he remained silent for some time. At length he said: &quot;Sire, I beg you
to pardon me if I am unable to reply as you might wish. I certainly did not
expect such a proposal as I am still so young, and I confess that the idea of
marrying is very distasteful to me. Possibly I may not always be in this mind,
but I certainly feel that it will require some time to induce me to take the
step which your Majesty desires.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This answer greatly distressed the king, who was
sincerely grieved by his objection to marriage. However he would not have
recourse to extreme measures, so he said: &quot;I do not wish to force you; I
will give you time to reflect, but remember that such a step is necessary, for
a prince such as you who will some day be called to rule over a great
kingdom.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From this time Prince Camaralzaman was admitted
to the royal council, and the king showed him every mark of favour. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the end of a year the king took his son
aside, and said: &quot;Well, my son, have you changed your mind on the subject
of marriage, or do you still refuse to obey my wish?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince was less surprised but no less firm
than on the former occasion, and begged his father not to press the subject,
adding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This answer much distressed the king, who again
confided his trouble to his vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have followed your advice,&quot; he
said; &quot;but Camaralzaman declines to marry, and is more obstinate than
ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the vizir, &quot;much
is gained by patience, and your Majesty might regret any violence. Why not wait
another year and then inform the Prince in the midst of the assembled council
that the good of the state demands his marriage? He cannot possibly refuse
again before so distinguished an assemblage, and in our immediate
presence.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan ardently desired to see his son
married at once, but he yielded to the vizir's arguments and decided to wait.
He then visited the prince's mother, and after telling her of his disappointment
and of the further respite he had given his son, he added: &quot;I know that
Camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me. Pray speak very seriously
to him on this subject, and make him realize that he will most seriously
displease me if he remains obstinate, and that he will certainly regret the
measures I shall be obliged to take to enforce my will.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the first time the Sultana Fatima saw her son
she told him she had heard of his refusal to marry, adding how distressed she
felt that he should have vexed his father so much. She asked what reasons he
could have for his objections to obey. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the prince, &quot;I
make no doubt that there are as many good, virtuous, sweet, and amiable women
as there are others very much the reverse. Would that all were like you! But
what revolts me is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at all
about her. My father will ask the hand of the daughter of some neighbouring
sovereign, who will give his consent to our union. Be she fair or frightful,
clever or stupid, good or bad, I must marry her, and am left no choice in the
matter. How am I to know that she will not be proud, passionate, contemptuous,
and recklessly extravagant, or that her disposition will in any way suit
mine?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But, my son,&quot; urged Fatima, &quot;you
surely do not wish to be the last of a race which has reigned so long and so
gloriously over this kingdom?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; said the prince, &quot;I have
no wish to survive the king, my father, but should I do so I will try to reign
in such a manner as may be considered worthy of my predecessors.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These and similar conversations proved to the
Sultan how useless it was to argue with his son, and the year elapsed without
bringing any change in the prince's ideas. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length a day came when the Sultan summoned
him before the council, and there informed him that not only his own wishes but
the good of the empire demanded his marriage, and desired him to give his
answer before the assembled ministers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this Camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke
with so much heat that the king, naturally irritated at being opposed by his
son in full council, ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up in an old
tower, where he had nothing but a very little furniture, a few books, and a
single slave to wait on him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman, pleased to be free to enjoy his
books, showed himself very indifferent to his sentence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When night came he washed himself, performed his
devotions, and, having read some pages of the Koran, lay down on a couch,
without putting out the light near him, and was soon asleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now there was a deep well in the tower in which
Prince Camaralzaman was imprisoned, and this well was a favourite resort of the
fairy Maimoune, daughter of Damriat, chief of a legion of genii. Towards
midnight Maimoune floated lightly up from the well, intending, according to her
usual habit, to roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident might
prompt. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The light in the prince's room surprised her,
and without disturbing the slave, who slept across the threshold, she entered
the room, and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it
occupied. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince lay with his face half hidden by the
coverlet. Maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth she
had ever seen. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What a marvel of beauty he must be when
his eyes are open!&quot; she thought. &quot;What can he have done to deserve to
be treated like this?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She could not weary gazing at Camaralzaman, but
at length, having softly kissed his brow and each cheek, she replaced the
coverlet and resumed her flight through the air. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As she entered the middle region she heard the
sound of great wings coming towards her, and shortly met one of the race of bad
genii. This genie, whose name was Danhasch, recognised Maimoune with terror,
for he knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her over him. He would gladly
have avoided her altogether, but they were so near that he must either be
prepared to fight or yield to her, so he at once addressed her in a
conciliatory tone: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good Maimoune, swear to me by Allah to do
me no harm, and on my side I will promise not to injure you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Accursed genie!&quot; replied Maimoune,
&quot;what harm can you do me? But I will grant your power and give the promise
you ask. And now tell me what you have seen and done to-night.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Fair lady,&quot; said Danhasch, &quot;you
meet me at the right moment to hear something really interesting. I must tell
you that I come from the furthest end of China, which is one of the largest and
most powerful kingdoms in the world. The present king has one only daughter,
who is so perfectly lovely that neither you, nor I, nor any other creature
could find adequate terms in which to describe her marvellous charms. You must
therefore picture to yourself the most perfect features, joined to a brilliant
and delicate complexion, and an enchanting expression, and even then
imagination will fall short of the reality. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The king, her father, has carefully
shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze, and has taken every precaution to
keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be
her husband. But in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built
her seven palaces such as have never been seen before. The first palace is
entirely composed of rock crystal, the second of bronze, the third of fine
steel, the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze, the fifth of
touchstone, the sixth of silver, and the seventh of solid gold. They are all
most sumptuously furnished, whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out
with exquisite taste. In fact, neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make
this retreat agreeable to the princess. The report of her wonderful beauty has
spread far and wide, and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her
hand in marriage. The king has always received these embassies graciously, but
says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will, and as
she regularly declines each fresh proposal, the envoys have had to leave as
disappointed in the result of their missions as they were gratified by their
magnificent receptions.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said the princess to her
father, &quot;you wish me to marry, and I know you desire to please me, for
which I am very grateful. But, indeed, I have no inclination to change my
state, for where could I find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful and
delightful surroundings? I feel that I could never be as happy with any husband
as I am here, and I beg you not to press one on me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;At last an embassy came from a king so
rich and powerful that the King of China felt constrained to urge this suit on
his daughter. He told her how important such an alliance would be, and pressed
her to consent. In fact, he pressed her so persistingly that the princess at
length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due to her father.
&quot;Sire,&quot; cried she angrily, &quot;do not speak further of this or any
other marriage or I will plunge this dagger in my breast and so escape from all
these importunities.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The king of China was extremely indignant
with his daughter and replied: &quot;You have lost your senses and you must be
treated accordingly.&quot; So he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her
palaces, and only allowed her ten old women, of whom her nurse was the head, to
wait on her and keep her company. He next sent letters to all the kings who had
sued for the princess's hand, begging they would think of her no longer, as she
was quite insane, and he desired his various envoys to make it known that
anyone who could cure her should have her to wife. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Fair Maimoune,&quot; continued Danhasch,
&quot;this is the present state of affairs. I never pass a day without going to
gaze on this incomparable beauty, and I am sure that if you would only
accompany me you would think the sight well worth the trouble, and own that you
never saw such loveliness before.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fairy only answered with a peal of laughter,
and when at length she had control of her voice she cried, &quot;Oh, come, you
are making game of me! I thought you had something really interesting to tell
me instead of raving about some unknown damsel. What would you say if you could
see the prince I have just been looking at and whose beauty is really
transcendent? That is something worth talking about, you would certainly quite
lose your head.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Charming Maimoune,&quot; asked Danhasch,
&quot;may I inquire who and what is the prince of whom you speak?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Know,&quot; replied Maimoune, &quot;that
he is in much the same case as your princess. The king, his father, wanted to
force him to marry, and on the prince's refusal to obey he has been imprisoned
in an old tower where I have just seen him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I don't like to contradict a lady,&quot;
said Danhasch, &quot;but you must really permit me to doubt any mortal being as
beautiful as my princess.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hold your tongue,&quot; cried Maimoune.
&quot;I repeat that is impossible.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, I don't wish to seem
obstinate,&quot; replied Danhasch, &quot;the best plan to test the truth of
what I say will be for you to let me take you to see the princess for
yourself.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;There is no need for that,&quot; retorted
Maimoune; &quot;we can satisfy ourselves in another way. Bring your princess
here and lay her down beside my prince. We can then compare them at leisure,
and decide which is in the right.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Danhasch readily consented, and after having the
tower where the prince was confined pointed out to him, and making a wager with
Maimoune as to the result of the comparison, he flew off to China to fetch the
princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In an incredibly short time Danhasch returned,
bearing the sleeping princess. Maimoune led him to the prince's room, and the
rival beauty was placed beside him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the prince and princess lay thus side by
side, an animated dispute as to their respective charms arose between the fairy
and the genius. Danhasch began by saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now you see that my princess is more
beautiful than your prince. Can you doubt any longer?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Doubt! Of course I do!&quot; exclaimed
Maimoune. &quot;Why, you must be blind not to see how much my prince excels
your princess. I do not deny that your princess is very handsome, but only look
and you must own that I am in the right.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;There is no need for me to look
longer,&quot; said Danhasch, &quot;my first impression will remain the same;
but of course, charming Maimoune, I am ready to yield to you if you insist on
it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;By no means,&quot; replied Maimoune.
&quot;I have no idea of being under any obligation to an accursed genius like
you. I refer the matter to an umpire, and shall expect you to submit to his
verdict.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Danhasch readily agreed, and on Maimoune
striking the floor with her foot it opened, and a hideous, hump-backed, lame,
squinting genius, with six horns on his head, hands like claws, emerged. As
soon as he beheld Maimoune he threw himself at her feet and asked her commands.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Rise, Caschcasch,&quot; said she. &quot;I
summoned you to judge between me and Danhasch. Glance at that couch, and say
without any partiality whether you think the youth or the maiden lying there
the more beautiful.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Caschcasch looked at the prince and princess
with every token of surprise and admiration. At length, having gazed long
without being able to come to a decision, he said </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam, I must confess that I should
deceive you were I to declare one to be handsomer than the other. There seems
to me only one way in which to decide the matter, and that is to wake one after
the other and judge which of them expresses the greater admiration for the
other.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This advice pleased Maimoune and Danhasch, and
the fairy at once transformed herself into the shape of a gnat and settling on
Camaralzaman's throat stung him so sharply that he awoke. As he did so his eyes
fell on the Princess of China. Surprised at finding a lady so near him, he
raised himself on one arm to look at her. The youth and beauty of the princess
at once awoke a feeling to which his heart had as yet been a stranger, and he
could not restrain his delight. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What loveliness! What charms! Oh, my
heart, my soul!&quot; he exclaimed, as he kissed her forehead, her eyes and
mouth in a way which would certainly have roused her had not the genie's
enchantments kept her asleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, fair lady!&quot; he cried, &quot;you
do not wake at the signs of Camaralzaman's love? Be you who you may, he is not
unworthy of you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It then suddenly occurred to him, that perhaps
this was the bride his father had destined for him, and that the King had
probably had her placed in this room in order to see how far Camaralzaman's aversion
to marriage would withstand her charms. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;At all events,&quot; he thought, &quot;I
will take this ring as a remembrance of her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying he drew off a fine ring which the
princess wore on her finger, and replaced it by one of his own. After which he
lay down again and was soon fast asleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Danhasch, in his turn, took the form of a
gnat and bit the princess on her lip. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She started up, and was not a little amazed at
seeing a young man beside her. From surprise she soon passed to admiration, and
then to delight on perceiving how handsome and fascinating he was. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why,&quot; cried she, &quot;was it you my
father wished me to marry? How unlucky that I did not know sooner! I should not
have made him so angry. But wake up! wake up! for I know I shall love you with
all my heart.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying she shook Camaralzaman so violently
that nothing but the spells of Maimoune could have prevented his waking. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the princess. &quot;Why
are you so drowsy?&quot; So saying she took his hand and noticed her own ring
on his finger, which made her wonder still more. But as he still remained in a
profound slumber she pressed a kiss on his cheek and soon fell fast asleep too.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then Maimoune turning to the genie said:
&quot;Well, are you satisfied that my prince surpasses your princess? Another
time pray believe me when I assert anything.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then turning to Caschcasch: &quot;My thanks to
you, and now do you and Danhasch bear the princess back to her own home.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two genii hastened to obey, and Maimoune
returned to her well. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On waking next morning the first thing Prince
Camaralzaman did was to look round for the lovely lady he had seen at night,
and the next to question the slave who waited on him about her. But the slave
persisted so strongly that he knew nothing of any lady, and still less of how
she got into the tower, that the prince lost all patience, and after giving him
a good beating tied a rope round him and ducked him in the well till the
unfortunate man cried out that he would tell everything. Then the prince drew him
up all dripping wet, but the slave begged leave to change his clothes first,
and as soon as the prince consented hurried off just as he was to the palace.
Here he found the king talking to the grand-vizir of all the anxiety his son
had caused him. The slave was admitted at once and cried: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas, Sire! I bring sad news to your
Majesty. There can be no doubt that the prince has completely lost his senses.
He declares that he saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night, and the state
you see me in proves how violent contradiction makes him.&quot; He then gave a
minute account of all the prince had said and done. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king, much moved, begged the vizir to
examine into this new misfortune, and the latter at once went to the tower,
where he found the prince quietly reading a book. After the first exchange of
greetings the vizir said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I feel really very angry with your slave
for alarming his Majesty by the news he brought him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What news?&quot; asked the prince. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah!&quot; replied the vizir, &quot;something
absurd, I feel sure, seeing how I find you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Most likely,&quot; said the prince;
&quot;but now that you are here I am glad of the opportunity to ask you where
is the lady who slept in this room last night?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir felt beside himself at this question.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prince!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;how
would it be possible for any man, much less a woman, to enter this room at
night without walking over your slave on the threshold? Pray consider the
matter, and you will realise that you have been deeply impressed by some
dream.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the prince angrily insisted on knowing who
and where the lady was, and was not to be persuaded by all the vizir's
protestations to the contrary that the plot had not been one of his making. At
last, losing patience, he seized the vizir by the beard and loaded him with
blows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Stop, Prince,&quot; cried the unhappy
vizir, &quot;stay and hear what I have to say.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince, whose arm was getting tired, paused.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I confess, Prince,&quot; said the vizir,
&quot;that there is some foundation for what you say. But you know well that a
minister has to carry out his master's orders. Allow me to go and to take to
the king any message you may choose to send.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Very well,&quot; said the prince;
&quot;then go and tell him that I consent to marry the lady whom he sent or
brought here last night. Be quick and bring me back his answer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir bowed to the ground and hastened to
leave the room and tower. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well,&quot; asked the king as soon as he
appeared, &quot;and how did you find my son?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas, sire,&quot; was the reply, &quot;the
slave's report is only too true!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He then gave an exact account of his interview
with Camaralzaman and of the prince's fury when told that it was not possible
for any lady to have entered his room, and of the treatment he himself had
received. The king, much distressed, determined to clear up the matter himself,
and, ordering the vizir to follow him, set out to visit his son. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince received his father with profound
respect, and the king, making him sit beside him, asked him several questions,
to which Camaralzaman replied with much good sense. At last the king said:
&quot;My son, pray tell me about the lady who, it is said, was in your room
last night.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the prince, &quot;pray
do not increase my distress in this matter, but rather make me happy by giving
her to me in marriage. However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly,
the sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices, and I will
gratefully receive her from your hands.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king was almost speechless on hearing his
son, but after a time assured him most solemnly that he knew nothing whatever
about the lady in question, and had not connived at her appearance. He then
desired the prince to relate the whole story to him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman did so at great length, showed the
ring, and implored his father to help to find the bride he so ardently desired.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;After all you tell me,&quot; remarked the
king, &quot;I can no longer doubt your word; but how and whence the lady came,
or why she should have stayed so short a time I cannot imagine. The whole
affair is indeed mysterious. Come, my dear son, let us wait together for
happier days.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying the king took Camaralzaman by the hand
and led him back to the palace, where the prince took to his bed and gave
himself up to despair, and the king shutting himself up with his son entirely
neglected the affairs of state. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prime minister, who was the only person
admitted, felt it his duty at last to tell the king how much the court and all
the people complained of his seclusion, and how bad it was for the nation. He
urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely little island close by,
whence he could easily attend public audiences, and where the charming scenery
and fine air would do the invalid so much good as to enable him to bear his
father's occasional absence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king approved the plan, and as soon as the
castle on the island could be prepared for their reception he and the prince
arrived there, Schahzaman never leaving his son except for the prescribed
public audiences twice a week. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst all this was happening in the capital of
Schahzaman the two genii had carefully borne the Princess of China back to her
own palace and replaced her in bed. On waking next morning she first turned
from one side to another and then, finding herself alone, called loudly for her
women. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell me,&quot; she cried, &quot;where is
the young man I love so dearly, and who slept near me last night?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Princess,&quot; exclaimed the nurse,
&quot;we cannot tell what you allude to without more explanation.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why,&quot; continued the princess,
&quot;the most charming and beautiful young man lay sleeping beside me last
night. I did my utmost to wake him, but in vain.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your Royal Highness wishes to make game of
us,&quot; said the nurse. &quot;Is it your pleasure to rise?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am quite in earnest,&quot; persisted the
princess, &quot;and I want to know where he is.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But, Princess,&quot; expostulated the
nurse, &quot;we left you quite alone last night, and we have seen no one enter
your room since then.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this the princess lost all patience, and
taking the nurse by her hair she boxed her ears soundly, crying out: &quot;You
shall tell me, you old witch, or I'll kill you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The nurse had no little trouble in escaping, and
hurried off to the queen, to whom she related the whole story with tears in her
eyes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You see, madam,&quot; she concluded,
&quot;that the princess must be out of her mind. If only you will come and see
her, you will be able to judge for yourself.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The queen hurried to her daughter's apartments,
and after tenderly embracing her, asked her why she had treated her nurse so
badly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; said the princess, &quot;I
perceive that your Majesty wishes to make game of me, but I can assure you that
I will never marry anyone except the charming young man whom I saw last night.
You must know where he is, so pray send for him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The queen was much surprised by these words, but
when she declared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess
lost all respect, and answered that if she were not allowed to marry as she
wished she should kill herself, and it was in vain that the queen tried to
pacify her and bring her to reason. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king himself came to hear the rights of the
matter, but the princess only persisted in her story, and as a proof showed the
ring on her finger. The king hardly knew what to make of it all, but ended by
thinking that his daughter was more crazy than ever, and without further
argument he had her placed in still closer confinement, with only her nurse to wait
on her and a powerful guard to keep the door. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he assembled his council, and having told
them the sad state of things, added: &quot;If any of you can succeed in curing
the princess, I will give her to him in marriage, and he shall be my
heir.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>An elderly emir present, fired with the desire
to possess a young and lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom, offered to
try the magic arts with which he was acquainted. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are welcome to try,&quot; said the
king, &quot;but I make one condition, which is, that should you fail you will
lose your life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The emir accepted the condition, and the king
led him to the princess, who, veiling her face, remarked, &quot;I am surprised,
sire, that you should bring an unknown man into my presence.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You need not be shocked,&quot; said the
king; &quot;this is one of my emirs who asks your hand in marriage.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the princess,
&quot;this is not the one you gave me before and whose ring I wear. Permit me
to say that I can accept no other.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The emir, who had expected to hear the princess
talk nonsense, finding how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king that
he could not venture to undertake a cure, but placed his head at his Majesty's
disposal, on which the justly irritated monarch promptly had it cut off. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This was the first of many suitors for the
princess whose inability to cure her cost them their lives. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it happened that after things had been going
on in this way for some time the nurse's son Marzavan returned from his
travels. He had been in many countries and learnt many things, including
astrology. Needless to say that one of the first things his mother told him was
the sad condition of the princess, his foster-sister. Marzavan asked if she
could not manage to let him see the princess without the king's knowledge. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After some consideration his mother consented,
and even persuaded the eunuch on guard to make no objection to Marzavan's
entering the royal apartment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess was delighted to see her
foster-brother again, and after some conversation she confided to him all her
history and the cause of her imprisonment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Marzavan listened with downcast eyes and the
utmost attention. When she had finished speaking he said, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If what you tell me, Princess, is indeed
the case, I do not despair of finding comfort for you. Take patience yet a
little longer. I will set out at once to explore other countries, and when you
hear of my return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far off.&quot; So
saying, he took his leave and started next morning on his travels. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Marzavan journeyed from city to city and from
one island and province to another, and wherever he went he heard people talk
of the strange story of the Princess Badoura, as the Princess of China was
named. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After four months he reached a large populous
seaport town named Torf, and here he heard no more of the Princess Badoura but
a great deal of Prince Camaralzaman, who was reported ill, and whose story
sounded very similar to that of the Princess Badoura. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Marzavan was rejoiced, and set out at once for
Prince Camaralzaman's residence. The ship on which he embarked had a prosperous
voyage till she got within sight of the capital of King Schahzaman, but when
just about to enter the harbour she suddenly struck on a rock, and foundered
within sight of the palace where the prince was living with his father and the
grand-vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Marzavan, who swam well, threw himself into the
sea and managed to land close to the palace, where he was kindly received, and
after having a change of clothing given him was brought before the grand-vizir.
The vizir was at once attracted by the young man's superior air and intelligent
conversation, and perceiving that he had gained much experience in the course
of his travels, he said, &quot;Ah, how I wish you had learnt some secret which
might enable you to cure a malady which has plunged this court into affliction
for some time past!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Marzavan replied that if he knew what the
illness was he might possibly be able to suggest a remedy, on which the vizir
related to him the whole history of Prince Camaralzaman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On hearing this Marzavan rejoiced inwardly, for
he felt sure that he had at last discovered the object of the Princess
Badoura's infatuation. However, he said nothing, but begged to be allowed to
see the prince. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On entering the royal apartment the first thing
which struck him was the prince himself, who lay stretched out on his bed with
his eyes closed. The king sat near him, but, without paying any regard to his
presence, Marzavan exclaimed, &quot;Heavens! what a striking likeness!&quot;
And, indeed, there was a good deal of resemblance between the features of
Camaralzaman and those of the Princess of China. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These words caused the prince to open his eyes
with languid curiosity, and Marzavan seized this moment to pay him his
compliments, contriving at the same time to express the condition of the
Princess of China in terms unintelligible, indeed, to the Sultan and his vizir,
but which left the prince in no doubt that his visitor could give him some
welcome information. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince begged his father to allow him the favour
of a private interview with Marzavan, and the king was only too pleased to find
his son taking an interest in anyone or anything. As soon as they were left
alone Marzavan told the prince the story of the Princess Badoura and her
sufferings, adding, &quot;I am convinced that you alone can cure her; but
before starting on so long a journey you must be well and strong, so do your
best to recover as quickly as may be.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These words produced a great effect on the
prince, who was so much cheered by the hopes held out that he declared he felt
able to get up and be dressed. The king was overjoyed at the result of
Marzavan's interview, and ordered public rejoicings in honour of the prince's
recovery. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before long the prince was quite restored to his
original state of health, and as soon as he felt himself really strong he took
Marzavan aside and said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now is the time to perform your promise. I
am so impatient to see my beloved princess once more that I am sure I shall
fall ill again if we do not start soon. The one obstacle is my father's tender
care of me, for, as you may have noticed, he cannot bear me out of his
sight.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prince,&quot; replied Marzavan, &quot;I
have already thought over the matter, and this is what seems to me the best
plan. You have not been out of doors since my arrival. Ask the king's
permission to go with me for two or three days' hunting, and when he has given
leave order two good horses to be held ready for each of us. Leave all the rest
to me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next day the prince seized a favourable
opportunity for making his request, and the king gladly granted it on condition
that only one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue after
such a long illness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next morning Prince Camaralzaman and Marzavan
were off betimes, attended by two grooms leading the two extra horses. They
hunted a little by the way, but took care to get as far from the towns as
possible. At night-fall they reached an inn, where they supped and slept till
midnight. Then Marzavan awoke and roused the prince without disturbing anyone
else. He begged the prince to give him the coat he had been wearing and to put
on another which they had brought with them. They mounted their second horses,
and Marzavan led one of the grooms' horses by the bridle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By daybreak our travellers found themselves
where four cross roads met in the middle of the forest. Here Marzavan begged
the prince to wait for him, and leading the groom's horse into a dense part of
the wood he cut its throat, dipped the prince's coat in its blood, and having
rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground where the roads parted. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In answer to Camaralzaman's inquiries as to the
reason for this, Marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing
their journey was to divert attention by creating the idea of the prince's
death. &quot;Your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief,&quot;
he went on, &quot;but his joy at your return will be all the greater.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince and his companion now continued their
journey by land and sea, and as they had brought plenty of money to defray
their expenses they met with no needless delays. At length they reached the
capital of China, where they spent three days in a suitable lodging to recover
from their fatigues. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>During this time Marzavan had an astrologer's
dress prepared for the prince. They then went to the baths, after which the
prince put on the astrologer's robe and was conducted within sight of the
king's palace by Marzavan, who left him there and went to consult his mother,
the princess's nurse. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meantime the prince, according to Marzavan's
instructions, advanced close to the palace gates and there proclaimed aloud: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am an astrologer and I come to restore
health to the Princess Badoura, daughter of the high and mighty King of China,
on the conditions laid down by His Majesty of marrying her should I succeed, or
of losing my life if I fail.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was some little time since anyone had
presented himself to run the terrible risk involved in attempting to cure the
princess, and a crowd soon gathered round the prince. On perceiving his youth,
good looks, and distinguished bearing, everyone felt pity for him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What are you thinking of, sir,&quot;
exclaimed some; &quot;why expose yourself to certain death? Are not the heads
you see exposed on the town wall sufficient warning? For mercy's sake give up
this mad idea and retire whilst you can.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the prince remained firm, and only repeated
his cry with greater assurance, to the horror of the crowd. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He is resolved to die!&quot; they cried;
&quot;may heaven have pity on him!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman now called out for the third time,
and at last the grand-vizir himself came out and fetched him in. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prime minister led the prince to the king,
who was much struck by the noble air of this new adventurer, and felt such pity
for the fate so evidently in store for him, that he tried to persuade the young
man to renounce his project. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But Camaralzaman politely yet firmly persisted
in his intentions, and at length the king desired the eunuch who had the guard
of the princess's apartments to conduct the astrologer to her presence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The eunuch led the way through long passages,
and Camaralzaman followed rapidly, in haste to reach the object of his desires.
At last they came to a large hall which was the ante-room to the princess's
chamber, and here Camaralzaman said to the eunuch: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now you shall choose. Shall I cure the
princess in her own presence, or shall I do it from here without seeing
her?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The eunuch, who had expressed many contemptuous
doubts as they came along of the newcomer's powers, was much surprised and said:
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you really can cure, it is immaterial
when you do it. Your fame will be equally great.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied the prince:
&quot;then, impatient though I am to see the princess, I will effect the cure
where I stand, the better to convince you of my power.&quot; He accordingly
drew out his writing case and wrote as follows--&quot;Adorable princess! The
enamoured Camaralzaman has never forgotten the moment when, contemplating your
sleeping beauty, he gave you his heart. As he was at that time deprived of the
happiness of conversing with you, he ventured to give you his ring as a token
of his love, and to take yours in exchange, which he now encloses in this
letter. Should you deign to return it to him he will be the happiest of
mortals, if not he will cheerfully resign himself to death, seeing he does so
for love of you. He awaits your reply in your ante-room.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having finished this note the prince carefully
enclosed the ring in it without letting the eunuch see it, and gave him the
letter, saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take this to your mistress, my friend, and
if on reading it and seeing its contents she is not instantly cured, you may
call me an impudent impostor.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The eunuch at once passed into the princess's
room, and handing her the letter said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam, a new astrologer has arrived, who
declares that you will be cured as soon as you have read this letter and seen
what it contains.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess took the note and opened it with
languid indifference. But no sooner did she see her ring than, barely glancing
at the writing, she rose hastily and with one bound reached the doorway and
pushed back the hangings. Here she and the prince recognised each other, and in
a moment they were locked in each other's arms, where they tenderly embraced,
wondering how they came to meet at last after so long a separation. The nurse,
who had hastened after her charge, drew them back to the inner room, where the
princess restored her ring to Camaralzaman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take it back,&quot; she said, &quot;I
could not keep it without returning yours to you, and I am resolved to wear
that as long as I live.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meantime the eunuch had hastened back to the
king. &quot;Sire,&quot; he cried, &quot;all the former doctors and astrologers
were mere quacks. This man has cured the princess without even seeing
her.&quot; He then told all to the king, who, overjoyed, hastened to his
daughter's apartments, where, after embracing her, he placed her hand in that
of the prince, saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Happy stranger, I keep my promise, and
give you my daughter to wife, be you who you may. But, if I am not much mistaken,
your condition is above what you appear to be.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince thanked the king in the warmest and
most respectful terms, and added: &quot;As regards my person, your Majesty has
rightly guessed that I am not an astrologer. It is but a disguise which I assumed
in order to merit your illustrious alliance. I am myself a prince, my name is
Camaralzaman, and my father is Schahzaman, King of the Isles of the Children of
Khaledan.&quot; He then told his whole history, including the extraordinary
manner of his first seeing and loving the Princess Badoura. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he had finished the king exclaimed:
&quot;So remarkable a story must not be lost to posterity. It shall be
inscribed in the archives of my kingdom and published everywhere abroad.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The wedding took place next day amidst great
pomp and rejoicings. Marzavan was not forgotten, but was given a lucrative post
at court, with a promise of further advancement. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince and princess were now entirely happy,
and months slipped by unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other's society. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One night, however, Prince Camaralzaman dreamt
that he saw his father lying at the point of death, and saying: &quot;Alas! my
son whom I loved so tenderly, has deserted me and is now causing my
death.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince woke with such a groan as to startle
the princess, who asked what was the matter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah!&quot; cried the prince, &quot;at this
very moment my father is perhaps no more!&quot; and he told his dream. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess said but little at the time, but
next morning she went to the king, and kissing his hand said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have a favour to ask of your Majesty,
and I beg you to believe that it is in no way prompted by my husband. It is
that you will allow us both to visit my father-in-law King Schahzaman.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sorry though the king felt at the idea of
parting with his daughter, he felt her request to be so reasonable that he
could not refuse it, and made but one condition, which was that she should only
spend one year at the court of King Schahzaman, suggesting that in future the
young couple should visit their respective parents alternately. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess brought this good news to her
husband, who thanked her tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All preparations for the journey were now
pressed forwards, and when all was ready the king accompanied the travellers for
some days, after which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter, and
charging the prince to take every care of her, returned to his capital. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince and princess journeyed on, and at the
end of a month reached a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees
which cast a most pleasant shade. As the heat was great, Camaralzaman thought
it well to encamp in this cool spot. Accordingly the tents were pitched, and
the princess entering hers whilst the prince was giving his further orders,
removed her girdle, which she placed beside her, and desiring her women to
leave her, lay down and was soon asleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the camp was all in order the prince
entered the tent and, seeing the princess asleep, he sat down near her without
speaking. His eyes fell on the girdle which, he took up, and whilst inspecting
the precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch sewn to the girdle and
fastened by a loop. He touched it and felt something hard within. Curious as to
what this might be, he opened the pouch and found a cornelian engraved with
various figures and strange characters. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This cornelian must be something very
precious,&quot; thought he, &quot;or my wife would not wear it on her person
with so much care.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In truth it was a talisman which the Queen of
China had given her daughter, telling her it would ensure her happiness as long
as she carried it about her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The better to examine the stone the prince
stepped to the open doorway of the tent. As he stood there holding it in the
open palm of his hand, a bird suddenly swooped down, picked the stone up in its
beak and flew away with it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Imagine the prince's dismay at losing a thing by
which his wife evidently set such store! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bird having secured its prey flew off some
yards and alighted on the ground, holding the talisman it its beak. Prince
Camaralzaman advanced, hoping the bird would drop it, but as soon as he
approached the thief fluttered on a little further still. He continued his
pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stone and took a longer flight than
before. The prince then hoped to kill it with a stone, but the more hotly he
pursued the further flew the bird. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In this fashion he was led on by hill and dale
through the entire day, and when night came the tiresome creature roosted on
the top of a very high tree where it could rest in safety. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince in despair at all his useless trouble
began to think whether he had better return to the camp. &quot;But,&quot;
thought he, &quot;how shall I find my way back? Must I go up hill or down? I
should certainly lose my way in the dark, even if my strength held out.&quot;
Overwhelmed by hunger, thirst, fatigue and sleep, he ended by spending the
night at the foot of the tree. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the
bird left its perch, and no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again
with as little success as the previous day, only stopping to eat some herbs and
fruit he found by the way. In this fashion he spent ten days, following the
bird all day and spending the night at the foot of a tree, whilst it roosted on
the topmost bough. On the eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large
town, and as soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a sudden and
higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight, whilst Camaralzaman felt
in despair at having to give up all hopes of ever recovering the talisman of
the Princess Badoura. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Much cast down, he entered the town, which was
built near the sea and had a fine harbour. He walked about the streets for a
long time, not knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the
seashore he found a garden door open and walked in. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener, a good old man, who was at work,
happened to look up, and, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as
a Mussulman, he told him to come in at once and to shut the door. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman did as he was bid, and inquired why
this precaution was taken. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Because,&quot; said the gardener, &quot;I
see that you are a stranger and a Mussulman, and this town is almost entirely
inhabited by idolaters, who hate and persecute all of our faith. It seems
almost a miracle that has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that you
have found a place of safety.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for
offering him shelter, and was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted
him with: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Leave compliments alone. You are weary and
must be hungry. Come in, eat, and rest.&quot; So saying he led the prince into
his cottage, and after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of his
arrival. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and
ended by inquiring the shortest way to his father's capital. &quot;For,&quot;
added he, &quot;if I tried to rejoin the princess, how should I find her after
eleven days' separation. Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer alive!&quot; At
this terrible thought he burst into tears. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener informed Camaralzaman that they
were quite a year's land journey to any Mahomedan country, but that there was a
much shorter route by sea to the Ebony Island, from whence the Isles of the Children
of Khaledan could be easily reached, and that a ship sailed once a year for the
Ebony Island by which he might get so far as his very home. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If only you had arrived a few days
sooner,&quot; he said, &quot;you might have embarked at once. As it is you must
now wait till next year, but if you care to stay with me I offer you my house,
such as it is, with all my heart.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Camaralzaman thought himself lucky to
find some place of refuge, and gladly accepted the gardener's offer. He spent
his days working in the garden, and his nights thinking of and sighing for his
beloved wife. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Let us now see what had become during this time
of the Princess Badoura. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On first waking she was much surprised not to
find the prince near her. She called her women and asked if they knew where he
was, and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent,
but had not noticed his leaving it, she took up her belt and perceived that the
little pouch was open and the talisman gone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She at once concluded that her husband had taken
it and would shortly bring it back. She waited for him till evening rather
impatiently, and wondering what could have kept him from her so long. When
night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its
maker roundly. In spite of her grief and anxiety however, she did not lose her
presence of mind, but decided on a courageous, though very unusual step. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Only the princess and her women knew of
Camaralzaman's disappearance, for the rest of the party were sleeping or resting
in their tents. Fearing some treason should the truth be known, she ordered her
women not to say a word which would give rise to any suspicion, and proceeded
to change her dress for one of her husband's, to whom, as has been already
said, she bore a strong likeness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In this disguise she looked so like the prince
that when she gave orders next morning to break up the camp and continue the
journey no one suspected the change. She made one of her women enter her
litter, whilst she herself mounted on horseback and the march began. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a protracted journey by land and sea the
princess, still under the name and disguise of Prince Camaralzaman, arrived at
the capital of the Ebony Island whose king was named Armanos. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>No sooner did the king hear that the ship which
was just in port had on board the son of his old friend and ally than he
hurried to meet the supposed prince, and had him and his retinue brought to the
palace, where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After three days, finding that his guest, to
whom he had taken a great fancy, talked of continuing his journey, King Armanos
said to him: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prince, I am now an old man, and
unfortunately I have no son to whom to leave my kingdom. It has pleased Heaven
to give me only one daughter, who possesses such great beauty and charm that I
could only give her to a prince as highly born and as accomplished as yourself.
Instead, therefore, of returning to your own country, take my daughter and my
crown and stay with us. I shall feel that I have a worthy successor, and shall
cheerfully retire from the fatigues of government.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king's offer was naturally rather
embarrassing to the Princess Badoura. She felt that it was equally impossible
to confess that she had deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on which he had
set his heart; a refusal which might turn all his kindness to hatred and
persecution. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All things considered, she decided to accept,
and after a few moments silence said with a blush, which the king attributed to
modesty: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire, I feel so great an obligation for
the good opinion your Majesty has expressed for my person and of the honour you
do me, that, though I am quite unworthy of it, I dare not refuse. But, sire, I
can only accept such an alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with
your counsels.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony
was fixed for the following day, and the princess employed the intervening time
in informing the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring them that
the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the marriage. She also told
her women, and bade them keep her secret well. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>King Armanos, delighted with the success of his
plans, lost no time in assembling his court and council, to whom he presented
his successor, and placing his future son-in-law on the throne made everyone do
homage and take oaths of allegiance to the new king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At night the whole town was filled with
rejoicings, and with much pomp the Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of
the king's daughter) was conducted to the palace of the Princess Badoura. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties
of her first interview with King Armanos' daughter, and she felt the only thing
to do was at once to take her into her confidence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Accordingly, as soon as they were alone she took
Haiatelnefous by the hand and said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and
must throw myself on your mercy. I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princess
like yourself and his wife, and I beg you to listen to my story, then I am sure
you will forgive my imposture, in consideration of my sufferings.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She then related her whole history, and at its
close Haiatelnefous embraced her warmly, and assured her of her entire sympathy
and affection. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two princesses now planned out their future
action, and agreed to combine to keep up the deception and to let Badoura
continue to play a man's part until such time as there might be news of the
real Camaralzaman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst these things were passing in the Ebony
Island Prince Camaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottage
in the town of the idolaters. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Early one morning the gardener said to the
prince: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To-day is a public holiday, and the people
of the town not only do not work themselves but forbid others to do so. You had
better therefore take a good rest whilst I go to see some friends, and as the
time is near for the arrival of the ship of which I told you I will make
inquiries about it, and try to bespeak a passage for you.&quot; He then put on
his best clothes and went out, leaving the prince, who strolled into the garden
and was soon lost in thoughts of his dear wife and their sad separation. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he walked up and down he was suddenly
disturbed in his reverie by the noise two large birds were making in a tree. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman stood still and looked up, and saw
that the birds were fighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long
one fell dead to the ground, whilst the conqueror spread his wings and flew
away. Almost immediately two other larger birds, who had been watching the
duel, flew up and alighted, one at the head and the other at the feet of the
dead bird. They stood there some time sadly shaking their heads, and then dug
up a grave with their claws in which they buried him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as they had filled in the grave the two
flew off, and ere long returned, bringing with them the murderer, whom they
held, one by a wing and the other by a leg, with their beaks, screaming and
struggling with rage and terror. But they held tight, and having brought him to
his victim's grave, they proceeded to kill him, after which they tore open his
body, scattered the inside and once more flew away. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince, who had watched the whole scene with
much interest, now drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the
dead bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of
its inside. He picked it up, and what was his surprise when he recognised the
Princess Badoura's talisman which had been the cause of many misfortunes. It
would be impossible to describe his joy; he kissed the talisman repeatedly,
wrapped it up, and carefully tied it round his arm. For the first time since
his separation from the princess he had a good night, and next morning he was
up at day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener told him to cut down an old fruit
tree which had quite died away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to
vigorously. As he was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something
hard. On pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze, under
which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps. He went down them and found
himself in a roomy kind of cave in which stood fifty large bronze jars, each
with a cover on it. The prince uncovered one after another, and found them all
filled with gold dust. Delighted with his discovery he left the cave, replaced
the slab, and having finished cutting down the tree waited for the gardener's
return. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener had heard the night before that the
ship about which he was inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not
being yet known he had been told to return next day for further information. He
had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with good news beaming in his
face. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son,&quot; said he, &quot;rejoice and
hold yourself ready to start in three days' time. The ship is to set sail, and
I have arranged all about your passage with the captain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You could not bring me better news,&quot;
replied Camaralzaman, &quot;and in return I have something pleasant to tell
you. Follow me and see the good fortune which has befallen you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He then led the gardener to the cave, and having
shown him the treasure stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heaven
should in this way reward his kind host's many virtues and compensate him for the
privations of many years. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the
gardener. &quot;Do you imagine that I should appropriate this treasure? It is
yours, and I have no right whatever to it. For the last eighty years I have dug
up the ground here without discovering anything. It is clear that these riches
are intended for you, and they are much more needed by a prince like yourself
than by an old man like me, who am near my end and require nothing. This
treasure comes just at the right time, when you are about to return to your own
country, where you will make good use of it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the prince would not hear of this
suggestion, and finally after much discussion they agreed to divide the gold.
When this was done the gardener said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son, the great thing now is to arrange
how you can best carry off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of
losing it. There are no olives in the Ebony Island, and those imported from
here fetch a high price. As you know, I have a good stock of the olives which
grew in this garden. Now you must take fifty jars, fill each half full of gold
dust and fill them up with the olives. We will then have them taken on board
ship when you embark.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince took this advice, and spent the rest
of the day filling the fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman might
slip from his arm and be lost again, he took the precaution of putting it in
one of the jars, on which he made a mark so as to be able to recognise it. When
night came the jars were all ready, and the prince and his host went to bed. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whether in consequence of his great age, or of
the fatigues and excitement of the previous day, I do not know, but the
gardener passed a very bad night. He was worse next day, and by the morning of
the third day was dangerously ill. At daybreak the ship's captain and some of
his sailors knocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger who was to
embark. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am he,&quot; said Camaralzaman, who had
opened the door. &quot;The gardener who took my passage is ill and cannot see
you, but please come in and take these jars of olives and my bag, and I will
follow as soon as I have taken leave of him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sailors did as he asked, and the captain
before leaving charged Camaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and
he wished to set sail at once. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as they were gone the prince returned to
the cottage to bid farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once more for
all his kindness. But the old man was at his last gasp, and had barely murmured
his confession of faith when he expired. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the
last offices, so having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man
up and buried him. He then locked the door, gave up the key to the owner of the
garden, and hurried to the quay only to hear that the ship had sailed long ago,
after waiting three hours for him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It may well be believed that the prince felt in
despair at this fresh misfortune, which obliged him to spend another year in a
strange and distasteful country. Moreover, he had once more lost the Princess
Badoura's talisman, which he feared he might never see again. There was nothing
left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done, and to live on in
the cottage. As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself, he engaged a
lad to help him, and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining
gold dust into fifty more jars, filling them up with olives so as to have them
ready for transport. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst the prince was settling down to this
second year of toil and privation, the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived
safely at the Ebony Island. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As the palace of the new king, or rather of the
Princess Badoura, overlooked the harbour, she saw the ship entering it and
asked what vessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags, and was told that
it was a ship from the Island of the Idolaters which yearly brought rich
merchandise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess, ever on the look out for any
chance of news of her beloved husband, went down to the harbour attended by
some officers of the court, and arrived just as the captain was landing. She
sent for him and asked many questions as to his country, voyage, what
passengers he had, and what his vessel was laden with. The captain answered all
her questions, and said that his passengers consisted entirely of traders who
brought rich stuffs from various countries, fine muslins, precious stones,
musk, amber, spices, drugs, olives, and many other things. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as he mentioned olives, the princess,
who was very partial to them, exclaimed: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will take all you have on board. Have
them unloaded and we will make our bargain at once, and tell the other
merchants to let me see all their best wares before showing them to other
people.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the captain, &quot;I
have on board fifty very large pots of olives. They belong to a merchant who
was left behind, as in spite of waiting for him he delayed so long that I was
obliged to set sail without him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Never mind,&quot; said the princess,
&quot;unload them all the same, and we will arrange the price.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The captain accordingly sent his boat off to the
ship and it soon returned laden with the fifty pots of olives. The princess
asked what they might be worth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the captain, &quot;the
merchant is very poor. Your Majesty will not overpay him if you give him a
thousand pieces of silver.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;In order to satisfy him and as he is so
poor,&quot; said the princess, &quot;I will order a thousand pieces of gold to
be given you, which you will be sure to remit to him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying she gave orders for the payment and
returned to the palace, having the jars carried before her. When evening came
the Princess Badoura retired to the inner part of the palace, and going to the
apartments of the Princess Haiatelnefous she had the fifty jars of olives
brought to her. She opened one to let her friend taste the olives and to taste
them herself, but great was her surprise when, on pouring some into a dish, she
found them all powdered with gold dust. &quot;What an adventure! how
extraordinary!&quot; she cried. Then she had the other jars opened, and was
more and more surprised to find the olives in each jar mixed with gold dust. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But when at length her talisman was discovered
in one of the jars her emotion was so great that she fainted away. The Princess
Haiatelnefous and her women hastened to restore her, and as soon as she
recovered consciousness she covered the precious talisman with kisses. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then, dismissing the attendants, she said to her
friend: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You will have guessed, my dear, that it
was the sight of this talisman which has moved me so deeply. This was the cause
of my separation from my dear husband, and now, I am convinced, it will be the
means of our reunion.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as it was light next day the Princess
Badoura sent for the captain, and made further inquiries about the merchant who
owned the olive jars she had bought. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In reply the captain told her all he knew of the
place where the young man lived, and how, after engaging his passage, he came
to be left behind. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If that is the case,&quot; said the
princess, &quot;you must set sail at once and go back for him. He is a debtor
of mine and must be brought here at once, or I will confiscate all your
merchandise. I shall now give orders to have all the warehouses where your
cargo is placed under the royal seal, and they will only be opened when you
have brought me the man I ask for. Go at once and obey my orders.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The captain had no choice but to do as he was
bid, so hastily provisioning his ship he started that same evening on his
return voyage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When, after a rapid passage, he gained sight of
the Island of Idolaters, he judged it better not to enter the harbour, but
casting anchor at some distance he embarked at night in a small boat with six
active sailors and landed near Camaralzaman's cottage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince was not asleep, and as he lay awake
moaning over all the sad events which had separated him from his wife, he
thought he heard a knock at the garden door. He went to open it, and was
immediately seized by the captain and sailors, who without a word of explanation
forcibly bore him off to the boat, which took them back to the ship without
loss of time. No sooner were they on board than they weighed anchor and set
sail. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman, who had kept silence till then,
now asked the captain (whom he had recognised) the reason for this abduction. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Are you not a debtor of the King of the
Ebony Island?&quot; asked the captain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I? Why, I never even heard of him before,
and never set foot in his kingdom!&quot; was the answer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, you must know better than I,&quot;
said the captain. &quot;You will soon see him now, and meantime be content
where you are and have patience.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The return voyage was as prosperous as the
former one, and though it was night when the ship entered the harbour, the
captain lost no time in landing with his passenger, whom he conducted to the
palace, where he begged an audience with the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Directly the Princess Badoura saw the prince she
recognised him in spite of his shabby clothes. She longed to throw herself on
his neck, but restrained herself, feeling it was better for them both that she
should play her part a little longer. She therefore desired one of her officers
to take care of him and to treat him well. Next she ordered another officer to
remove the seals from the warehouse, whilst she presented the captain with a
costly diamond, and told him to keep the thousand pieces of gold paid for the
olives, as she would arrange matters with the merchant himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She then returned to her private apartments,
where she told the Princess Haiatelnefous all that had happened, as well as her
plans for the future, and begged her assistance, which her friend readily
promised. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next morning she ordered the prince to be taken
to the bath and clothed in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a
province. He was then introduced to the council, where his good looks and grand
air drew the attention of all on him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Princess Badoura, delighted to see him looking
himself once more, turned to the other emirs, saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lords, I introduce to you a new
colleague, Camaralzaman, whom I have known on my travels and who, I can assure
you, you will find well deserves your regard and admiration.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the
king--whom he never suspected of being a woman in disguise--asserting their
acquaintance, for he felt sure he had never seen her before. However he
received all the praises bestowed on him with becoming modesty, and prostrating
himself, said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire, I cannot find words in which to
thank your Majesty for the great honour conferred on me. I can but assure you
that I will do all in my power to prove myself worthy of it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On leaving the council the prince was conducted
to a splendid house which had been prepared for him, where he found a full
establishment and well-filled stables at his orders. On entering his study his
steward presented him with a coffer filled with gold pieces for his current
expenses. He felt more and more puzzled by such good fortune, and little
guessed that the Princess of China was the cause of it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a few days the Princess Badoura promoted
Camaralzaman to the post of grand treasurer, an office which he filled with so
much integrity and benevolence as to win universal esteem. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He would now have thought himself the happiest
of men had it not been for that separation which he never ceased to bewail. He
had no clue to the mystery of his present position, for the princess, out of
compliment to the old king, had taken his name, and was generally known as King
Armanos the younger, few people remembering that on her first arrival she went
by another name. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length the princess felt that the time had
come to put an end to her own and the prince's suspense, and having arranged
all her plans with the Princess Haiatelnefous, she informed Camaralzaman that
she wished his advice on some important business, and, to avoid being
disturbed, desired him to come to the palace that evening. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince was punctual, and was received in the
private apartment, when, having ordered her attendants to withdraw, the
princess took from a small box the talisman, and, handing it to Camaralzaman,
said: &quot;Not long ago an astrologer gave me this talisman. As you are
universally well informed, you can perhaps tell me what is its use.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Camaralzaman took the talisman and, holding it
to the light, cried with surprise, &quot;Sire, you ask me the use of this
talisman. Alas! hitherto it has been only a source of misfortune to me, being
the cause of my separation from the one I love best on earth. The story is so
sad and strange that I am sure your Majesty will be touched by it if you will
permit me to tell it you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will hear it some other time,&quot;
replied the princess. &quot;Meanwhile I fancy it is not quite unknown to me.
Wait here for me. I will return shortly.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying she retired to another room, where she
hastily changed her masculine attire for that of a woman, and, after putting on
the girdle she wore the day they parted, returned to Camaralzaman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince recognised her at once, and,
embracing her with the utmost tenderness, cried, &quot;Ah, how can I thank the
king for this delightful surprise?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do not expect ever to see the king
again,&quot; said the princess, as she wiped the tears of joy from her eyes,
&quot;in me you see the king. Let us sit down, and I will tell you all about
it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She then gave a full account of all her
adventures since their parting, and dwelt much on the charms and noble
disposition of the Princess Haiatelnefous, to whose friendly assistance she
owed so much. When she had done she asked to hear the prince's story, and in
this manner they spent most of the night. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next morning the princess resumed her woman's
clothes, and as soon as she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg King
Armanos to come to her apartments. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the king arrived great was his surprise at
finding a strange lady in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual
right to enter the private apartment. Seating himself he asked for the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said the princess,
&quot;yesterday I was the king, to-day I am only the Princess of China and wife
to the real Prince Camaralzaman, son of King Schahzaman, and I trust that when
your Majesty shall have heard our story you will not condemn the innocent
deception I have been obliged to practise.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king consented to listen, and did so with
marked surprise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the close of her narrative the princess said,
&quot;Sire, as our religion allows a man to have more than one wife, I would
beg your Majesty to give your daughter, the Princess Haiatelnefous, in marriage
to Prince Camaralzaman. I gladly yield to her the precedence and title of Queen
in recognition of the debt of gratitude which I owe her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>King Armanos heard the princess with surprise
and admiration, then, turning to Camaralzaman, he said, &quot;My son, as your
wife, the Princess Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law),
consents to share your hand and affections with my daughter, I have only to ask
if this marriage is agreeable to you, and if you will consent to accept the
crown which the Princess Badoura deserves to wear all her life, but which she
prefers to resign for love of you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Camaralzaman, &quot;I
can refuse your Majesty nothing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Accordingly Camaralzaman was duly proclaimed
king, and as duly married with all pomp to the Princess Haiatelnefous, with
whose beauty, talents, and affections he had every reason to be pleased. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two queens lived in true sisterly harmony
together, and after a time each presented King Camaralzaman with a son, whose
births were celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost rejoicing. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Balsora was the capital of a kingdom long
tributary to the caliph. During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the
king of Balsora, who was his cousin, was called Zinebi. Not thinking one vizir
enough for the administration of his estates he had two, named Khacan and
Saouy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took
pleasure in obliging, as far as in him lay, those who had business with him.
Throughout the entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem and praise
him as he deserved. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Saouy was quite a different character, and
repelled everyone with whom he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in
spite of his great riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the
necessaries of life. What made him particularly detested was the great aversion
he had to Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day, while the king amused himself talking
with his two vizirs and other members of the council, the conversation turned
on female slaves. While some declared that it sufficed for a slave to be
beautiful, others, and Khacan was among the number, maintained that beauty
alone was not enough, but that it must be accompanied by wit, wisdom, modesty,
and, if possible, knowledge. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king not only declared himself to be of this
opinion, but charged Khacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these
conditions. Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was jealous of the
honour done to Khacan, said, &quot;Sire, it will be very difficult to find a
slave as accomplished as your Majesty desires, and, if she is to be found, she
will be cheap if she cost less than 10,000 gold pieces.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Saouy,&quot; answered the king, &quot;you
seem to find that a very great sum. For you it may be so, but not for me.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer,
who was present, to send 10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the
slave. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon, then, as Khacan returned home he sent
for the dealers in female slaves, and charged them directly they had found such
a one as he described to inform him. They promised to do their utmost, and no
day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspection but none was
found without some defect. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length, early one morning, while Khacan was
on his way to the king's palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way,
announced eagerly that a Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening,
had a slave to sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that
the slave should be brought for his inspection on his return from the palace.
The dealer appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slave beautiful
beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the name of &quot;The Fair
Persian.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Being a man of great wisdom and learning, he
perceived in the short conversation he had with her that he would seek in vain
another slave to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king, and
therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant put upon her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir,&quot; was the answer, &quot;for less
than 10,000 gold pieces he will not let her go; he declares that, what with
masters for her instruction, and for bodily exercises, not to speak of clothing
and nourishment, he has already spent that sum upon her. She is in every way
fit to be the slave of a king; she plays every musical instrument, she sings,
she dances, she makes verses, in fact there is no accomplishment in which she
does not excel.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Khacan, who was better able to judge of her
merits than the dealer, wishing to bring the matter to a conclusion, sent for
the merchant, and said to him, &quot;It is not for myself that I wish to buy
your slave, but for the king. Her price, however, is too high.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir,&quot; replied the merchant, &quot;I
should esteem it an honour to present her to his Majesty, did it become a
merchant to do such a thing. I ask no more than the sum it has cost me to make
her such as she is.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Khacan, not wishing to bargain, immediately had
the sum counted out, and given to the merchant, who before withdrawing said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir, as she is destined for the king, I
would have you observe that she is extremely tired with the long journey, and
before presenting her to his Majesty you would do well to keep her a fortnight
in your own house, and to see that a little care is bestowed upon her. The sun
has tanned her complexion, but when she has been two or three times to the
bath, and is fittingly dressed, you will see how much her beauty will be
increased.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Khacan thanked the merchant for his advice, and
determined to follow it. He gave the beautiful Persian an apartment near to
that of his wife, whom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady destined for
the king, and to order for her the most magnificent garments. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before bidding adieu to the fair Persian, he
said to her: &quot;No happiness can be greater than what I have procured for
you; judge for yourself, you now belong to the king. I have, however, to warn
you of one thing. I have a son, who, though not wanting in sense, is young,
foolish, and headstrong, and I charge you to keep him at a distance.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Persian thanked him for his advice, and
promised to profit by it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin--for so the vizir's son was
named--went freely in and out of his mother's apartments. He was young,
well-made and agreeable, and had the gift of charming all with whom he came in
contact. As soon as he saw the beautiful Persian, though aware that she was
destined for the king, he let himself be carried away by her charms, and
determined at once to use every means in his power to retain her for himself.
The Persian was equally captivated by Noureddin, and said to herself: &quot;The
vizir does me too great honour in buying me for the king. I should esteem
myself very happy if he would give me to his son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin availed himself of every opportunity
to gaze upon her beauty, to talk and laugh with her, and never would have left
her side if his mother had not forced him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some time having elapsed, on account of the long
journey, since the beautiful Persian had been to the bath, five or six days
after her purchase the vizir's wife gave orders that the bath should be heated
for her, and that her own female slaves should attend her there, and
after-wards should array her in a magnificent dress that had been prepared for
her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Her toilet completed, the beautiful Persian came
to present herself to the vizir's wife, who hardly recognised her, so greatly
was her beauty increased. Kissing her hand, the beautiful slave said:
&quot;Madam, I do not know how you find me in this dress that you have had
prepared for me; your women assure me that it suits me so well that they hardly
knew me. If it is the truth they tell me, and not flattery, it is to you I owe
the transformation.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My daughter,&quot; answered the vizir's
wife, &quot;they do not flatter you. I myself hardly recognised you. The
improvement is not due to the dress alone, but largely to the beautifying
effects of the bath. I am so struck by its results, that I would try it on
myself.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Acting forthwith on this decision she ordered
two little slaves during her absence to watch over the beautiful Persian, and
not to allow Noureddin to enter should he come. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She had no sooner gone than he arrived, and not
finding his mother in her apartment, would have sought her in that of the
Persian. The two little slaves barred the entrance, saying that his mother had
given orders that he was not to be admitted. Taking each by an arm, he put them
out of the anteroom, and shut the door. Then they rushed to the bath, informing
their mistress with shrieks and tears that Noureddin had driven them away by
force and gone in. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This news caused great consternation to the
lady, who, dressing herself as quickly as possible, hastened to the apartment
of the fair Persian, to find that Noureddin had already gone out. Much
astonished to see the vizir's wife enter in tears, the Persian asked what
misfortune had happened. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed the lady, &quot;you
ask me that, knowing that my son Noureddin has been alone with you?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But, madam,&quot; inquired the Persian,
&quot;what harm is there in that?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How! Has my husband not told you that you
are destined for the king?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Certainly, but Noureddin has just been to
tell me that his father has changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him. I
believed him, and so great is my affection for Noureddin that I would willingly
pass my life with him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Would to heaven,&quot; exclaimed the wife
of the vizir, &quot;that what you say were true; but Noureddin has deceived
you, and his father will sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has
done.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying, she wept bitterly, and all her slaves
wept with her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Khacan, entering shortly after this, was much
astonished to find his wife and her slaves in tears, and the beautiful Persian
greatly perturbed. He inquired the cause, but for some time no answer was
forthcoming. When his wife was at length sufficiently calm to inform him of
what had happened, his rage and mortification knew no bounds. Wringing his
hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wretched son! thou destroyest not only
thyself but thy father. The king will shed not only thy blood but mine.&quot;
His wife tried to console him, saying: &quot;Do not torment thyself. With the
sale of my jewels I will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum you will
buy another slave.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do not suppose,&quot; replied her husband,
&quot;that it is the loss of the money that affects me. My honour is at stake,
and that is more precious to me than all my wealth. You know that Saouy is my
mortal enemy. He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the
consequences that will ensue.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; said his wife, &quot;I am
quite aware of Saouy's baseness, and that he is capable of playing you this
malicious trick. But how can he or any one else know what takes place in this
house? Even if you are suspected and the king accuses you, you have only to say
that, after examining the slave, you did not find her worthy of his Majesty.
Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers, saying that you are not satisfied,
and wish them to find you another slave.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided
to follow it, but his wrath against his son did not abate. Noureddin dared not
appear all that day, and fearing to take refuge with his usual associates in
case his father should seek him there, he spent the day in a secluded garden
where he was not known. He did not return home till after his father had gone
to bed, and went out early next morning before the vizir awoke, and these
precautions he kept up during an entire month. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His mother, though knowing very well that he
returned to the house every evening, dare not ask her husband to pardon him. At
length she took courage and said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord, I know that a son could not act
more basely towards his father than Noureddin has done towards you, but after
all will you now pardon him? Do you not consider the harm you may be doing
yourself, and fear that malicious people, seeking the cause of your
estrangement, may guess the real one?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the vizir, &quot;what
you say is very just, but I cannot pardon Noureddin before I have mortified him
as he deserves.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He will be sufficiently punished,&quot;
answered the lady, &quot;if you do as I suggest. In the evening, when he
returns home, lie in wait for him and pretend that you will slay him. I will
come to his aid, and while pointing out that you only yield his life at my
supplications, you can force him to take the beautiful Persian on any
conditions you please.&quot; Khacan agreed to follow this plan, and everything
took place as arranged. On Noureddin's return Khacan pretended to be about to
slay him, but yielding to his wife's intercession, said to his son: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You owe your life to your mother. I pardon
you on her intercession, and on the conditions that you take the beautiful
Persian for your wife, and not your slave, that you never sell her, nor put her
away.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin, not hoping for so great indulgence,
thanked his father, and vowed to do as he desired. Khacan was at great pains
frequently to speak to the king of the difficulties attending the commission he
had given him, but some whispers of what had actually taken place did reach
Saouy's ears. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>More than a year after these events the minister
took a chill, leaving the bath while still heated to go out on important
business. This resulted in inflammation of the lungs, which rapidly increased.
The vizir, feeling that his end was at hand, sent for Noureddin, and charged
him with his dying breath never to part with the beautiful Persian. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Shortly afterwards he expired, leaving universal
regret throughout the kingdom; rich and poor alike followed him to the grave.
Noureddin showed every mark of the deepest grief at his father's death, and for
long refused to see any one. At length a day came when, one of his friends
being admitted, urged him strongly to be consoled, and to resume his former
place in society. This advice Noureddin was not slow to follow, and soon he formed
little society of ten young men all about his own age, with whom he spent all
his time in continual feasting and merry-making. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sometimes the fair Persian consented to appear
at these festivities, but she disapproved of this lavish expenditure, and did not
scruple to warn Noureddin of the probable consequences. He, however, only
laughed at her advice, saying, that his father had always kept him in too great
constraint, and that now he rejoiced at his new-found liberty. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>What added to the confusion in his affairs was
that he refused to look into his accounts with his steward, sending him away
every time he appeared with his book. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;See only that I live well,&quot; he said,
&quot;and do not disturb me about anything else.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Not only did Noureddin's friends constantly partake
of his hospitality, but in every way they took advantage of his generosity;
everything of his that they admired, whether land, houses, baths, or any other
source of his revenue, he immediately bestowed on them. In vain the Persian
protested against the wrong he did himself; he continued to scatter with the
same lavish hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing
but amuse himself, and dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to
acquire. The year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat at table, there
came a knock at the door. The slaves having been sent away, Noureddin went to
open it himself. One of his friends had risen at the same time, but Noureddin
was before him, and finding the intruder to be the steward, he went out and
closed the door. The friend, curious to hear what passed between them, hid
himself behind the hangings, and heard the following words: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; said the steward, &quot;I
beg a thousand pardons for interrupting you, but what I have long foreseen has
taken place. Nothing remains of the sums you gave me for your expenses, and all
other sources of income are also at end, having been transferred by you to
others. If you wish me to remain in your service, furnish me with the necessary
funds, else I must withdraw.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So great was Noureddin's consternation that he
had not a word to say in reply. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The friend, who had been listening behind the
curtain, immediately hastened to communicate the news to the rest of the
company. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If this is so,&quot; they said, &quot;we
must cease to come here.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin re-entering at that moment, they
plainly saw, in spite of his efforts to dissemble, that what they had heard was
the truth. One by one they rose, and each with a different excuse left the
room, till presently he found himself alone, though little suspecting the
resolution his friends had taken. Then, seeing the beautiful Persian, he
confided to her the statement of the steward, with many expressions of regret
for his own carelessness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Had I but followed your advice, beautiful
Persian,&quot; he said, &quot;all this would not have happened, but at least I
have this consolation, that I have spent my fortune in the company of friends
who will not desert me in an hour of need. To-morrow I will go to them, and
amongst them they will lend me a sum sufficient to start in some
business.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Accordingly next morning early Noureddin went to
seek his ten friends, who all lived in the same street. Knocking at the door of
the first and chief, the slave who opened it left him to wait in a hall while
he announced his visit to his master. &quot;Noureddin!&quot; he heard him
exclaim quite audibly. &quot;Tell him, every time he calls, that I am not at
home.&quot; The same thing happened at the second door, and also at the third,
and so on with all the ten. Noureddin, much mortified, recognised too late that
he had confided in false friends, who abandoned him in his hour of need.
Overwhelmed with grief, he sought consolation from the beautiful Persian. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas, my lord,&quot; she said, &quot;at
last you are convinced of the truth of what I foretold. There is now no other
resource left but to sell your slaves and your furniture.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>First then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for
a time on the proceeds, after that the furniture was sold, and as much of it
was valuable it sufficed for some time. Finally this resource also came to an
end, and again he sought counsel from the beautiful Persian. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; she said, &quot;I know that
the late vizir, your father, bought me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I
have diminished in value since, I should still fetch a large sum. Do not
therefore hesitate to sell me, and with the money you obtain go and establish
yourself in business in some distant town.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Charming Persian,&quot; answered
Noureddin, &quot;how could I be guilty of such baseness? I would die rather
than part from you whom I love better than my life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; she replied, &quot;I am
well aware of your love for me, which is only equalled by mine for you, but a
cruel necessity obliges us to seek the only remedy.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin, convinced at length of the truth of
her words, yielded, and reluctantly led her to the slave market, where, showing
her to a dealer named Hagi Hassan, he inquired her value. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Taking them into a room apart, Hagi Hassan
exclaimed as soon as she had unveiled, &quot;My lord, is not this the slave
your father bought for 10,000 pieces?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On learning that it was so, he promised to
obtain the highest possible price for her. Leaving the beautiful Persian shut
up in the room alone, he went out to seek the slave merchants, announcing to
them that he had found the pearl among slaves, and asking them to come and put
a value upon her. As soon as they saw her they agreed that less than 4,000 gold
pieces could not be asked. Hagi Hassan, then closing the door upon her, began
to offer her for sale--calling out: &quot;Who will bid 4,000 gold pieces for
the Persian slave?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before any of the merchants had bid, Saouy
happened to pass that way, and judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary
beauty, rode up to Hagi Hassan and desired to see her. Now it was not the
custom to show a slave to a private bidder, but as no one dared to disobey the
vizir his request was granted. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as Saouy saw the Persian he was so
struck by her beauty, that he immediately wished to possess her, and not
knowing that she belonged to Noureddin, he desired Hagi Hassan to send for the
owner and to conclude the bargain at once. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hagi Hassan then sought Noureddin, and told him
that his slave was going far below her value, and that if Saouy bought her he
was capable of not paying the money. &quot;What you must do,&quot; he said,
&quot;is to pretend that you had no real intention of selling your slave, and
only swore you would in a fit of anger against her. When I present her to Saouy
as if with your consent you must step in, and with blows begin to lead her
away.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin did as Hagi Hassan advised, to the
great wrath of Saouy, who riding straight at him endeavoured to take the
beautiful Persian from him by force. Noureddin letting her go, seized Saouy's
horse by the bridle, and, encouraged by the applause of the bystanders, dragged
him to the ground, beat him severely, and left him in the gutter streaming with
blood. Then, taking the beautiful Persian, he returned home amidst the
acclamations of the people, who detested Saouy so much that they would neither
interfere in his behalf nor allow his slaves to protect him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Covered from head to foot with mire and
streaming with blood he rose, and leaning on two of his slaves went straight to
the palace, where he demanded an audience of the king, to whom he related what
had taken place in these words: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;May it please your Majesty, I had gone to
the slave market to buy myself a cook. While there I heard a slave being
offered for 4,000 pieces. Asking to see her, I found she was of incomparable
beauty, and was being sold by Noureddin, the son of your late vizir, to whom
your Majesty will remember giving a sum of 10,000 gold pieces for the purchase
of a slave. This is the identical slave, whom instead of bringing to your
Majesty he gave to his own son. Since the death of his father this Noureddin
has run through his entire fortune, has sold all his possessions, and is now
reduced to selling the slave. Calling him to me, I said: &quot;Noureddin, I
will give you 10,000 gold pieces for your slave, whom I will present to the
king. I will interest him at the same time in your behalf, and this will be
worth much more to you than what extra money you might obtain from the
merchants.&quot; &quot;Bad old man,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;rather than sell
my slave to you I would give her to a Jew.&quot; &quot;But, Noureddin,&quot; I
remonstrated, &quot;you do not consider that in speaking thus you wrong the
king, to whom your father owed everything.&quot; This remonstrance only
irritated him the more. Throwing himself on me like a madman, he tore me from
my horse, beat me to his heart's content, and left me in the state your Majesty
sees.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying Saouy turned aside his head and wept
bitterly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king's wrath was kindled against Noureddin.
He ordered the captain of the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage
Noureddin's house, to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the
slave to him. A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan's,
hearing this order given, slipped out of the king's apartment, and hastened to
warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with the beautiful Persian. Then,
presenting him with forty gold pieces, he disappeared before Noureddin had time
to thank him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on
her veil they fled together, and had the good fortune to get out of the town
without being observed. At the mouth of the Euphrates they found a ship just
about to start for Bagdad. They embarked, and immediately the anchor was raised
and they set sail. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the captain of the guard reached
Noureddin's house he caused his soldiers to burst open the door and to enter by
force, but no trace was to be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could the
neighbours give any information about them. When the king heard that they had
escaped, he issued a proclamation that a reward of 1,000 gold pieces would be
given to whoever would bring him Noureddin and the slave, but that, on the
contrary, whoever hid them would be severely punished. Meanwhile Noureddin and
the fair Persian had safely reached Bagdad. When the vessel had come to an
anchor they paid five gold pieces for their passage and went ashore. Never
having been in Bagdad before, they did not know where to seek a lodging.
Wandering along the banks of the Tigris, they skirted a garden enclosed by a
high wall. The gate was shut, but in front of it was an open vestibule with a
sofa on either side. &quot;Here,&quot; said Noureddin, &quot;let us pass the
night,&quot; and reclining on the sofas they soon fell asleep. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now this garden belonged to the Caliph. In the
middle of it was a vast pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each
window having a lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there.
Only the door-keeper lived there, an old soldier named Scheih Ibrahim, who had
strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted, and never to allow any one
to sit on the sofas by the door. It happened that evening that he had gone out
on an errand. When he came back and saw two persons asleep on the sofas he was
about to drive them out with blows, but drawing nearer he perceived that they
were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman, and decided to awake them
by gentler means. Noureddin, on being awoke, told the old man that they were
strangers, and merely wished to pass the night there. &quot;Come with me,&quot;
said Scheih Ibrahim, &quot;I will lodge you better, and will show you a
magnificent garden belonging to me.&quot; So saying the doorkeeper led the way
into the Caliph's garden, the beauties of which filled them with wonder and
amazement. Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to Scheih
Ibrahim said, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I beg you to get us something to eat that
we may make merry together.&quot; Being very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim
determined to spend only the tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to
himself. While he was gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered through the
gardens and went up the white marble staircase of the pavilion as far as the
locked door of the saloon. On the return of Scheih Ibrahim they begged him to
open it, and to allow them to enter and admire the magnificence within.
Consenting, he brought not only the key, but a light, and immediately unlocked
the door. Noureddin and the Persian entering, were dazzled with the
magnificence they beheld. The paintings and furniture were of astonishing
beauty, and between each window was a silver arm holding a candle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scheih Ibrahim spread the table in front of a
sofa, and all three ate together. When they had finished eating Noureddin asked
the old man to bring them a bottle of wine. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Heaven forbid,&quot; said Scheih Ibrahim,
&quot;that I should come in contact with wine! I who have four times made the
pilgrimage to Mecca, and have renounced wine for ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You would, however, do us a great service
in procuring us some,&quot; said Noureddin. &quot;You need not touch it
yourself. Take the ass which is tied to the gate, lead it to the nearest
wine-shop, and ask some passer-by to order two jars of wine; have them put in
the ass's panniers, and drive him before you. Here are two pieces of gold for
the expenses.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at
once to execute the commission. On his return, Noureddin said: &quot;We have
still need of cups to drink from, and of fruit, if you can procure us
some.&quot; Scheih Ibrahim disappeared again, and soon returned with a table
spread with cups of gold and silver, and every sort of beautiful fruit. Then he
withdrew, in spite of repeated invitations to remain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin and the beautiful Persian, finding the
wine excellent, drank of it freely, and while drinking they sang. Both had fine
voices, and Scheih Ibrahim listened to them with great pleasure--first from a
distance, then he drew nearer, and finally put his head in at the door.
Noureddin, seeing him, called to him to come in and keep them company. At first
the old man declined, but was persuaded to enter the room, to sit down on the
edge of the sofa nearest the door, and at last to draw closer and to seat
himself by the beautiful Persian, who urged him so persistently to drink her
health that at length he yielded, and took the cup she offered. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the old man only made a pretence of
renouncing wine; he frequented wine-shops like other people, and had taken none
of the precautions Noureddin had proposed. Having once yielded, he was easily
persuaded to take a second cup, and a third, and so on till he no longer knew
what he was doing. Till near midnight they continued drinking, laughing, and
singing together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>About that time the Persian, perceiving that the
room was lit by only one miserable tallow candle, asked Scheih Ibrahim to light
some of the beautiful candles in the silver arms. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Light them yourself,&quot; answered the
old man; &quot;you are younger than I, but let five or six be enough.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She did not stop, however, till she had lit all
the eighty, but Scheih Ibrahim was not conscious of this, and when, soon after
that, Noureddin proposed to have some of the lustres lit, he answered: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are more capable of lighting them than
I, but not more than three.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin, far from contenting himself with
three, lit all, and opened all the eighty windows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, chancing at that
moment to open a window in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden, was
surprised to see the pavilion brilliantly illuminated. Calling the grand-vizir,
Giafar, he said to him: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Negligent vizir, look at the pavilion, and
tell me why it is lit up when I am not there.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the vizir saw that it was as the Caliph
said, he trembled with fear, and immediately invented an excuse. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; he said,
&quot;I must tell you that four or five days ago Scheih Ibrahim told me that he
wished to have an assembly of the ministers of his mosque, and asked permission
to hold it in the pavilion. I granted his request, but forgot since to mention
it to your Majesty.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Giafar,&quot; replied the Caliph, &quot;you
have committed three faults--first, in giving the permission; second, in not
mentioning it to me; and third, in not investigating the matter more closely.
For punishment I condemn you to spend the rest of the night with me in company
of these worthy people. While I dress myself as a citizen, go and disguise
yourself, and then come with me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they reached the garden gate they found it
open, to the great indignation of the Caliph. The door of the pavilion being
also open, he went softly upstairs, and looked in at the half-closed door of
the saloon. Great was his surprise to see Scheih Ibrahim, whose sobriety he had
never doubted, drinking and singing with a young man and a beautiful lady. The
Caliph, before giving way to his anger, determined to watch and see who the
people were and what they did. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Presently Scheih Ibrahim asked the beautiful
Persian if anything were wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If only,&quot; she said, &quot;I had an
instrument upon which I might play.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scheih Ibrahim immediately took a lute from a
cup-board and gave it to the Persian, who began to play on it, singing the
while with such skill and taste that the Caliph was enchanted. When she ceased
he went softly downstairs and said to the vizir: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Never have I heard a finer voice, nor the
lute better played. I am determined to go in and make her play to me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; said the
vizir, &quot;if Scheih Ibrahim recognises you he will die of fright.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I should be sorry for that,&quot; answered
the Caliph, &quot;and I am going to take steps to prevent it. Wait here till I
return.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the Caliph had caused a bend in the river to
form a lake in his garden. There the finest fish in the Tigris were to be
found, but fishing was strictly forbidden. It happened that night, however,
that a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate being open to go in and cast
his nets. He was just about to draw them when he saw the Caliph approaching.
Recognising him at once in spite of his disguise, he threw himself at his feet
imploring forgiveness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Fear nothing,&quot; said the Caliph,
&quot;only rise up and draw thy nets.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman did as he was told, and produced
five or six fine fish, of which the Caliph took the two largest. Then he
desired the fisherman to change clothes with him, and in a few minutes the
Caliph was transformed into a fisherman, even to the shoes and the turban.
Taking the two fish in his hand, he returned to the vizir, who, not recognising
him, would have sent him about his business. Leaving the vizir at the foot of
the stairs, the Caliph went up and knocked at the door of the saloon. Noureddin
opened it, and the Caliph, standing on the threshold, said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Scheih Ibrahim, I am the fisher Kerim.
Seeing that you are feasting with your friends, I bring you these fish.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin and the Persian said that when the
fishes were properly cooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them. The
Caliph then returned to the vizir, and they set to work in Scheih Ibrahim's
house to cook the fish, of which they made so tempting a dish that Noureddin
and the fair Persian ate of it with great relish. When they had finished
Noureddin took thirty gold pieces (all that remained of what Sangiar had given
him) and presented them to the Caliph, who, thanking him, asked as a further
favour if the lady would play him one piece on the lute. The Persian gladly
consented, and sang and played so as to delight the Caliph. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin, in the habit of giving to others
whatever they admired, said, &quot;Fisherman, as she pleases you so much, take
her; she is yours.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fair Persian, astounded that he should wish
to part from her, took her lute, and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches
to its music. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph (still in the character of fisherman)
said to him, &quot;Sir, I perceive that this fair lady is your slave. Oblige
me, I beg you, by relating your history.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin willingly granted this request, and
recounted everything from the purchase of the slave down to the present moment.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And where do you go now?&quot; asked the
Caliph. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wherever the hand of Allah leads me,&quot;
said Noureddin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then, if you will listen to me,&quot; said
the Caliph, &quot;you will immediately return to Balsora. I will give you a
letter to the king, which will ensure you a good reception from him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is an unheard-of thing,&quot; said Noureddin,
&quot;that a fisherman should be in correspondence with a king.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let not that astonish you,&quot; answered
the Caliph; &quot;we studied together, and have always remained the best of
friends, though fortune, while making him a king, left me a humble
fisherman.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph then took a sheet of paper, and wrote
the following letter, at the top of which he put in very small characters this
formula to show that he must be implicitly obeyed:--&quot;In the name of the
Most Merciful God. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Letter of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid to
the King of Balsora. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Haroun-al-Raschid, son of Mahdi, sends
this letter to Mohammed Zinebi, his cousin. As soon as Noureddin, son of the
Vizir Khacan, bearer of this letter, has given it to thee, and thou hast read
it, take off thy royal mantle, put it on his shoulders, and seat him in thy
place without fail. Farewell.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph then gave this letter to Noureddin,
who immediately set off, with only what little money he possessed when Sangiar
came to his assistance. The beautiful Persian, inconsolable at his departure,
sank on a sofa bathed in tears. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Noureddin had left the room, Scheih
Ibrahim, who had hitherto kept silence, said: &quot;Kerim, for two miserable
fish thou hast received a purse and a slave. I tell thee I will take the slave,
and as to the purse, if it contains silver thou mayst keep one piece, if gold
then I will take all and give thee what copper pieces I have in my purse.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now here it must be related that when the Caliph
went upstairs with the plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the
palace and bring back four slaves bearing a change of raiment, who should wait
outside the pavilion till the Caliph should clap his hands. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Still personating the fisherman, the Caliph
answered: &quot;Scheih Ibrahim, whatever is in the purse I will share equally
with you, but as to the slave I will keep her for myself. If you do not agree
to these conditions you shall have nothing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old man, furious at this insolence as he
considered it, took a cup and threw it at the Caliph, who easily avoided a
missile from the hand of a drunken man. It hit against the wall, and broke into
a thousand pieces. Scheih Ibrahim, still more enraged, then went out to fetch a
stick. The Caliph at that moment clapped his hands, and the vizir and the four
slaves entering took off the fisherman's dress and put on him that which they
had brought. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Scheih Ibrahim returned, a thick stick in
his hand, the Caliph was seated on his throne, and nothing remained of the fisherman
but his clothes in the middle of the room. Throwing himself on the ground at
the Caliph's feet, he said: &quot;Commander of the Faithful, your miserable
slave has offended you, and craves forgiveness.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph came down from his throne, and said:
&quot;Rise, I forgive thee.&quot; Then turning to the Persian he said:
&quot;Fair lady, now you know who I am; learn also that I have sent Noureddin
to Balsora to be king, and as soon as all necessary preparations are made I
will send you there to be queen. Meanwhile I will give you an apartment in my
palace, where you will be treated with all honour.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this the beautiful Persian took courage, and
the Caliph was as good as his word, recommending her to the care of his wife
Zobeida. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Noureddin made all haste on his journey to
Balsora, and on his arrival there went straight to the palace of the king, of
whom he demanded an audience. It was immediately granted, and holding the
letter high above his head he forced his way through the crowd. While the king
read the letter he changed colour. He would instantly have executed the
Caliph's order, but first he showed the letter to Saouy, whose interests were
equally at stake with his own. Pretending that he wished to read it a second
time, Saouy turned aside as if to seek a better light; unperceived by anyone he
tore off the formula from the top of the letter, put it to his mouth, and
swallowed it. Then, turning to the king, he said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your majesty has no need to obey this
letter. The writing is indeed that of the Caliph, but the formula is absent.
Besides, he has not sent an express with the patent, without which the letter
is useless. Leave all to me, and I will take the consequences.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king not only listened to the persuasions of
Saouy, but gave Noureddin into his hands. Such a severe bastinado was first
administered to him, that he was left more dead than alive; then Saouy threw
him into the darkest and deepest dungeon, and fed him only on bread and water.
After ten days Saouy determined to put an end to Noureddin's life, but dared
not without the king's authority. To gain this end, he loaded several of his
own slaves with rich gifts, and presented himself at their head to the king,
saying that they were from the new king on his coronation. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What!&quot; said the king; &quot;is that
wretch still alive? Go and behead him at once. I authorise you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said Saouy, &quot;I thank your
Majesty for the justice you do me. I would further beg, as Noureddin publicly
affronted me, that the execution might be in front of the palace, and that it
might be proclaimed throughout the city, so that no one may be ignorant of
it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king granted these requests, and the
announcement caused universal grief, for the memory of Noureddin's father was
still fresh in the hearts of his people. Saouy, accompanied by twenty of his
own slaves, went to the prison to fetch Noureddin, whom he mounted on a
wretched horse without a saddle. Arrived at the palace, Saouy went in to the
king, leaving Noureddin in the square, hemmed in not only by Saouy's slaves but
by the royal guard, who had great difficulty in preventing the people from
rushing in and rescuing Noureddin. So great was the indignation against Saouy
that if anyone had set the example he would have been stoned on his way through
the streets. Saouy, who witnessed the agitation of the people from the windows
of the king's privy chambers, called to the executioner to strike at once. The
king, however, ordered him to delay; not only was he jealous of Saouy's
interference, but he had another reason. A troop of horsemen was seen at that
moment riding at full gallop towards the square. Saouy suspected who they might
be, and urged the king to give the signal for the execution without delay, but
this the king refused to do till he knew who the horsemen were. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now, they were the vizir Giafar and his suite
arriving at full speed from Bagdad. For several days after Noureddin's
departure with the letter the Caliph had forgotten to send the express with the
patent, without which the letter was useless. Hearing a beautiful voice one day
in the women's part of the palace uttering lamentations, he was informed that
it was the voice of the fair Persian, and suddenly calling to mind the patent,
he sent for Giafar, and ordered him to make for Balsora with the utmost
speed--if Noureddin were dead, to hang Saouy; if he were still alive, to bring
him at once to Bagdad along with the king and Saouy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Giafar rode at full speed through the square,
and alighted at the steps of the palace, where the king came to greet him. The
vizir's first question was whether Noureddin were still alive. The king replied
that he was, and he was immediately led forth, though bound hand and foot. By
the vizir's orders his bonds were immediately undone, and Saouy was tied with
the same cords. Next day Giafar returned to Bagdad, bearing with him the king,
Saouy, and Noureddin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Caliph heard what treatment Noureddin
had received, he authorised him to behead Saouy with his own hands, but he
declined to shed the blood of his enemy, who was forthwith handed over to the
executioner. The Caliph also desired Noureddin to reign over Balsora, but this,
too, he declined, saying that after what had passed there he preferred never to
return, but to enter the service of the Caliph. He became one of his most
intimate courtiers, and lived long in great happiness with the fair Persian. As
to the king, the Caliph contented himself with sending him back to Balsora,
with the recommendation to be more careful in future in the choice of his
vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son
called Aladdin, a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long
in the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the father
that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tears and prayers, Aladdin did not
mend his ways. One day, when he was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger
asked him his age, and if he were not the son of Mustapha the tailor. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am, sir,&quot; replied Aladdin;
&quot;but he died a long while ago.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On this the stranger, who was a famous African
magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying: &quot;I am your uncle, and
knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell her I am
coming.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin ran home, and told his mother of his
newly found uncle. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Indeed, child,&quot; she said, &quot;your
father had a brother, but I always thought he was dead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin
seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently fell down and
kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin's mother not to be
surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out of the
country. He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy
hung his head, while his mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was
idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it
with merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes, and took
him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall
to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next day the magician led Aladdin into some
beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates. They sat down by a
fountain, and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided
between them. They then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the
mountains. Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician
beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last they came to two mountains divided by a
narrow valley. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We will go no farther,&quot; said the
false uncle. &quot;I will show you something wonderful; only do you gather up
sticks while I kindle a fire.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When it was lit the magician threw on it a
powder he had about him, at the same time saying some magical words. The earth
trembled a little and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone
with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by. Aladdin tried to run away, but
the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What have I done, uncle?&quot; he said
piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: &quot;Fear nothing, but
obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one
else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the word treasure, Aladdin forgot his fears,
and grasped the ring as he was told, saying the names of his father and
grandfather. The stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go down,&quot; said the magician; &quot;at
the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large
halls. Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything, or you
will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees. Walk on
till you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the
oil it contains and bring it to me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to
Aladdin, bidding him prosper. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin found everything as the magician had
said, gathered some fruit off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at
the mouth of the cave. The magician cried out in a great hurry: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Make haste and give me the lamp.&quot;
This Aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave. The magician flew into
a terrible passion, and throwing some more powder on the fire, he said
something, and the stone rolled back into its place. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly
showed that he was no uncle of Aladdin's, but a cunning magician who had read
in his magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful
man in the world. Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive
it from the hand of another. He had picked out the foolish Aladdin for this
purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him afterwards. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For two days Aladdin remained in the dark,
crying and lamenting. At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing
rubbed the ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately
an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave
of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin fearlessly replied: &quot;Deliver me
from this place!&quot; whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself
outside. As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but fainted on
the threshold. When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and
showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were in
reality precious stones. He then asked for some food. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas! child,&quot; she said, &quot;I have
nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell
it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would
sell the lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might
fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she
would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Fetch me something to eat!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve
silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine.
Aladdin's mother, when she came to herself, said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Whence comes this splendid feast?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ask not, but eat,&quot; replied Aladdin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So they sat at breakfast till it was
dinner-time, and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell
it, and have nothing to do with devils. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No,&quot; said Aladdin, &quot;since chance
has made us aware of its virtues, we will use it and the ring likewise, which I
shall always wear on my finger.&quot; When they had eaten all the genie had
brought, Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on till none were left.
He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates, and thus
they lived for many years. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan
proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the
princess, his daughter, went to and from the bath. Aladdin was seized by a
desire to see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled. He
hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink. The princess
lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in
love with her at first sight. He went home so changed that his mother was
frightened. He told her he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live
without her, and meant to ask her in marriage of her father. His mother, on
hearing this, burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go
before the Sultan and carry his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it
the magic fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the
most beautiful jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan, and set
out, trusting in the lamp. The grand-vizir and the lords of council had just
gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan. He,
however, took no notice of her. She went every day for a week, and stood in the
same place. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the council broke up on the sixth day the
Sultan said to his vizir: &quot;I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber
every day carrying something in a napkin. Call her next time, that I may find
out what she wants.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up
to the foot of the throne, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her:
&quot;Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but
the vizir, and bade her speak freely, promising to forgive her beforehand for
anything she might say. She then told him of her son's violent love for the
princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I prayed him to forget her,&quot; she
said, &quot;but in vain; he threatened to do some desperate deed if I refused
to go and ask your Majesty for the hand of the princess. Now I pray you to
forgive not me alone, but my son Aladdin.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the
napkin, whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was thunderstruck, and turning to the vizir
said: &quot;What sayest thou? Ought I not to bestow the princess on one who
values her at such a price?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir, who wanted her for his own son,
begged the Sultan to withhold her for three months, in the course of which he
hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted
this, and told Aladdin's mother that, though he consented to the marriage, she
must not appear before him again for three months. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three
months, but after two had elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil,
found everyone rejoicing, and asked what was going on. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you not know,&quot; was the answer,
&quot;that the son of the grand-vizir is to marry the Sultan's daughter
to-night?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Breathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was
overwhelmed at first, but presently bethought him of the lamp. He rubbed it,
and the genie appeared, saying: &quot;What is thy will?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin replied: &quot;The Sultan, as thou
knowest, has broken his promise to me, and the vizir's son is to have the
princess. My command is that to-night you bring hither the bride and
bridegroom.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Master, I obey,&quot; said the genie. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure
enough at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the vizir's son and
the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take this new-married man,&quot; he said,
&quot;and put him outside in the cold, and return at daybreak.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whereupon the genie took the vizir's son out of
bed, leaving Aladdin with the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Fear nothing,&quot; Aladdin said to her;
&quot;you are my wife, promised to me by your unjust father, and no harm shall
come to you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess was too frightened to speak, and
passed the most miserable night of her life, while Aladdin lay down beside her
and slept soundly. At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering
bridegroom, laid him in his place, and transported the bed back to the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter
good-morning. The unhappy vizir's son jumped up and hid himself, while the
princess would not say a word, and was very sorrowful. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan sent her mother to her, who said:
&quot;How comes it, child, that you will not speak to your father? What has
happened?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess sighed deeply, and at last told her
mother how, during the night, the bed had been carried into some strange house,
and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the least, but
bade her rise and consider it an idle dream. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The following night exactly the same thing
happened, and next morning, on the princess's refusing to speak, the Sultan
threatened to cut off her head. She then confessed all, bidding him ask the
vizir's son if it were not so. The Sultan told the vizir to ask his son, who
owned the truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the princess, he had rather
die than go through another such fearful night, and wished to be separated from
her. His wish was granted, and there was an end of feasting and rejoicing. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the three months were over, Aladdin sent
his mother to remind the Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as
before, and the Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and
sent for her. On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to
keep his word, and asked the vizir's advice, who counselled him to set so high
a value on the princess that no man living could come up to it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan then turned to Aladdin's mother,
saying: &quot;Good woman, a Sultan must remember his promises, and I will
remember mine, but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of
jewels, carried by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly
dressed. Tell him that I await his answer.&quot; The mother of Aladdin bowed
low and went home, thinking all was lost. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She gave Aladdin the message, adding: &quot;He
may wait long enough for your answer!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Not so long, mother, as you think,&quot;
her son replied &quot;I would do a great deal more than that for the
princess.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the
eighty slaves arrived, and filled up the small house and garden. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin made them set out to the palace, two and
two, followed by his mother. They were so richly dressed, with such splendid
jewels in their girdles, that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of
gold they carried on their heads. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They entered the palace, and, after kneeling
before the Sultan, stood in a half-circle round the throne with their arms
crossed, while Aladdin's mother presented them to the Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He hesitated no longer, but said: &quot;Good
woman, return and tell your son that I wait for him with open arms.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding him
make haste. But Aladdin first called the genie. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I want a scented bath,&quot; he said,
&quot;a richly embroidered habit, a horse surpassing the Sultan's, and twenty
slaves to attend me. Besides this, six slaves, beautifully dressed, to wait on
my mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his
horse and passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those
who had played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown so
handsome. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Sultan saw him he came down from his
throne, embraced him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread,
intending to marry him to the princess that very day. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But Aladdin refused, saying, &quot;I must build
a palace fit for her,&quot; and took his leave. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once home he said to the genie: &quot;Build me a
palace of the finest marble, set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones.
In the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome, its four walls of
massy gold and silver, each side having six windows, whose lattices, all except
one, which is to be left unfinished, must be set with diamonds and rubies. There
must be stables and horses and grooms and slaves; go and see about it!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The palace was finished by next day, and the
genie carried him there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out,
even to the laying of a velvet carpet from Aladdin's palace to the Sultan's.
Aladdin's mother then dressed herself carefully, and walked to the palace with
her slaves, while he followed her on horseback. The Sultan sent musicians with
trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air resounded with music and cheers.
She was taken to the princess, who saluted her and treated her with great
honour. At night the princess said good-bye to her father, and set out on the
carpet for Aladdin's palace, with his mother at her side, and followed by the
hundred slaves. She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive
her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Princess,&quot; he said, &quot;blame your
beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She told him that, having seen him, she
willingly obeyed her father in this matter. After the wedding had taken place
Aladdin led her into the hall, where a feast was spread, and she supped with
him, after which they danced till midnight. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the
palace. On entering the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies,
diamonds, and emeralds, he cried: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is a world's wonder! There is only one
thing that surprises me. Was it by accident that one window was left
unfinished?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, sir, by design,&quot; returned
Aladdin. &quot;I wished your Majesty to have the glory of finishing this
palace.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was pleased, and sent for the best
jewelers in the city. He showed them the unfinished window, and bade them fit
it up like the others. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir,&quot; replied their spokesman,
&quot;we cannot find jewels enough.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan had his own fetched, which they soon
used, but to no purpose, for in a month's time the work was not half done.
Aladdin, knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry
the jewels back, and the genie finished the window at his command. The Sultan
was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited Aladdin, who showed him
the window finished. The Sultan embraced him, the envious vizir meanwhile
hinting that it was the work of enchantment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his
gentle bearing. He was made captain of the Sultan's armies, and won several
battles for him, but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus in
peace and content for several years. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But far away in Africa the magician remembered
Aladdin, and by his magic arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing
miserably in the cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom he
was living in great honour and wealth. He knew that the poor tailor's son could
only have accomplished this by means of the lamp, and travelled night and day
till he reached the capital of China, bent on Aladdin's ruin. As he passed
through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Forgive my ignorance,&quot; he asked,
&quot;what is this palace you speak of?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin's
palace,&quot; was the reply, &quot;the greatest wonder of the world? I will
direct you if you have a mind to see it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The magician thanked him who spoke, and having
seen the palace knew that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp, and
became half mad with rage. He determined to get hold of the lamp, and again
plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight
days, which gave the magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps,
put them into a basket, and went to the palace, crying: &quot;New lamps for
old!&quot; followed by a jeering crowd. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess, sitting in the hall of
four-and-twenty windows, sent a slave to find out what the noise was about, who
came back laughing, so that the princess scolded her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the slave, &quot;who
can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for
old ones?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Another slave, hearing this, said: &quot;There
is an old one on the cornice there which he can have.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now this was the magic lamp, which Aladdin had
left there, as he could not take it out hunting with him. The princess, not
knowing its value, laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She went and said to the magician: &quot;Give me
a new lamp for this.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He snatched it and bade the slave take her
choice, amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he cared, but left off crying his
lamps, and went out of the city gates to a lonely place, where he remained till
nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared, and
at the magician's command carried him, together with the palace and the
princess in it, to a lonely place in Africa. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window
towards Aladdin's palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for the
vizir, and asked what had become of the palace. The vizir looked out too, and
was lost in astonishment. He again put it down to enchantment, and this time
the Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains.
They met him riding home, bound him, and forced him to go with them on foot.
The people, however, who loved him, followed, armed, to see that he came to no
harm. He was carried before the Sultan, who ordered the executioner to cut off
his head. The executioner made Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and
raised his scimitar to strike. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At that instant the vizir, who saw that the
crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to
rescue Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people, indeed,
looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be
unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin now begged to know what he had done. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;False wretch!&quot; said the Sultan,
&quot;come hither,&quot; and showed him from the window the place where his
palace had stood. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a
word. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Where is my palace and my daughter?&quot;
demanded the Sultan. &quot;For the first I am not so deeply concerned, but my
daughter I must have, and you must find her or lose your head.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find
her, promising if he failed to return and suffer death at the Sultan's
pleasure. His prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the Sultan's
presence. For three days he wandered about like a madman, asking everyone what
had become of his palace, but they only laughed and pitied him. He came to the
banks of a river, and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in.
In so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The genie he had seen in the cave appeared, and
asked his will. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Save my life, genie,&quot; said Aladdin,
&quot;and bring my palace back.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is not in my power,&quot; said the
genie; &quot;I am only the slave of the ring; you must ask the slave of the
lamp.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Even so,&quot; said Aladdin &quot;but thou
canst take me to the palace, and set me down under my dear wife's window.&quot;
He at once found himself in Africa, under the window of the princess, and fell
asleep out of sheer weariness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and
his heart was lighter. He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to
the loss of the lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That morning the princess rose earlier than she
had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company
she was forced to endure once a day. She, however, treated him so harshly that
he dared not live there altogether. As she was dressing, one of her women
looked out and saw Aladdin. The princess ran and opened the window, and at the
noise she made Aladdin looked up. She called to him to come to her, and great
was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After he had kissed her Aladdin said: &quot;I
beg of you, Princess, in God's name, before we speak of anything else, for your
own sake and mine, tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice
in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot; she said &quot;I am the
innocent cause of our sorrows,&quot; and told him of the exchange of the lamp. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now I know,&quot; cried Aladdin,
&quot;that we have to thank the African magician for this! Where is the
lamp?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He carries it about with him,&quot; said
the princess, &quot;I know, for he pulled it out of his breast to show me. He
wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him, saying that you were
beheaded by my father's command. He is forever speaking ill of you, but I only
reply by my tears. If I persist, I doubt not that he will use violence.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while.
He changed clothes with the first person he met in the town, and having bought
a certain powder returned to the princess, who let him in by a little side
door. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Put on your most beautiful dress,&quot; he
said to her, &quot;and receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe
that you have forgotten me. Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to
taste the wine of his country. He will go for some, and while he is gone I will
tell you what to do.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She listened carefully to Aladdin, and when he
left her arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She put
on a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and seeing in a glass that she looked
more beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying to his great amazement:
&quot;I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that all my tears will
not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore
invited you to sup with me; but I am tired of the wines of China, and would
fain taste those of Africa.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The magician flew to his cellar, and the
princess put the powder Aladdin had given her in her cup. When he returned she
asked him to drink her health in the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in
exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before drinking the magician made her a speech
in praise of her beauty, but the princess cut him short saying: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let me drink first, and you shall say what
you will afterwards.&quot; She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while
the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess then opened the door to Aladdin,
and flung her arms round his neck, but Aladdin put her away, bidding her to
leave him, as he had more to do. He then went to the dead magician, took the
lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to
China. This was done, and the princess in her chamber only felt two little
shocks, and little thought she was at home again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet,
mourning for his lost daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes, for
there stood the palace as before! He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him
in the hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the princess at his side.
Aladdin told him what had happened, and showed him the dead body of the
magician, that he might believe. A ten days' feast was proclaimed, and it
seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace; but it was
not to be. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The African magician had a younger brother, who
was, if possible, more wicked and more cunning than himself. He travelled to
China to avenge his brother's death, and went to visit a pious woman called
Fatima, thinking she might be of use to him. He entered her cell and clapped a
dagger to her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death.
He changed clothes with her, coloured his face like hers, put on her veil and
murdered her, that she might tell no tales. Then he went towards the palace of
Aladdin, and all the people thinking he was the holy woman, gathered round him,
kissing his hands and begging his blessing. When he got to the palace there was
such a noise going on round him that the princess bade her slave look out of
the window and ask what was the matter. The slave said it was the holy woman,
curing people by her touch of their ailments, whereupon the princess, who had
long desired to see Fatima, sent for her. On coming to the princess the
magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity. When he had done
the princess made him sit by her, and begged him to stay with her always. The
false Fatima, who wished for nothing better, consented, but kept his veil down
for fear of discovery. The princess showed him the hall, and asked him what he
thought of it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is truly beautiful,&quot; said the
false Fatima. &quot;In my mind it wants but one thing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And what is that?&quot; said the princess.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If only a roc's egg,&quot; replied he,
&quot;were hung up from the middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the
world.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After this the princess could think of nothing
but a roc's egg, and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very
ill humour. He begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all her
pleasure in the hall was spoilt for the want of a roc's egg hanging from the
dome. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It that is all,&quot; replied Aladdin,
&quot;you shall soon be happy.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the
genie appeared commanded him to bring a roc's egg. The genie gave such a loud
and terrible shriek that the hall shook. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wretch!&quot; he cried, &quot;is it not
enough that I have done everything for you, but you must command me to bring my
master and hang him up in the midst of this dome? You and your wife and your
palace deserve to be burnt to ashes; but this request does not come from you,
but from the brother of the African magician whom you destroyed. He is now in
your palace disguised as the holy woman--whom he murdered. He it was who put
that wish into your wife's head. Take care of yourself, for he means to kill
you.&quot; So saying the genie disappeared. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Aladdin went back to the princess, saying his
head ached, and requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her
hands on it. But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger,
pierced him to the heart. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What have you done?&quot; cried the
princess. &quot;You have killed the holy woman!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Not so,&quot; replied Aladdin, &quot;but a
wicked magician,&quot; and told her of how she had been deceived. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace.
He succeeded the Sultan when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving
behind him a long line of kings.</span></p>

Caliph of Bagdad</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid sat in his palace,
wondering if there was anything left in the world that could possibly give him
a few hours' amusement, when Giafar the grand-vizir, his old and tried friend,
suddenly appeared before him. Bowing low, he waited, as was his duty, till his
master spoke, but Haroun-al-Raschid merely turned his head and looked at him,
and sank back into his former weary posture. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now Giafar had something of importance to say to
the Caliph, and had no intention of being put off by mere silence, so with
another low bow in front of the throne, he began to speak. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; said he,
&quot;I have taken on myself to remind your Highness that you have undertaken
secretly to observe for yourself the manner in which justice is done and order
is kept throughout the city. This is the day you have set apart to devote to
this object, and perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may find some distraction
from the melancholy to which, as I see to my sorrow, you are a prey.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are right,&quot; returned the Caliph,
&quot;I had forgotten all about it. Go and change your coat, and I will change
mine.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A few moments later they both re-entered the
hall, disguised as foreign merchants, and passed through a secret door, out
into the open country. Here they turned towards the Euphrates, and crossing the
river in a small boat, walked through that part of the town which lay along the
further bank, without seeing anything to call for their interference. Much
pleased with the peace and good order of the city, the Caliph and his vizir
made their way to a bridge, which led straight back to the palace, and had
already crossed it, when they were stopped by an old and blind man, who begged
for alms. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph gave him a piece of money, and was
passing on, but the blind man seized his hand, and held him fast. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Charitable person,&quot; he said,
&quot;whoever you may be grant me yet another prayer. Strike me, I beg of you,
one blow. I have deserved it richly, and even a more severe penalty.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph, much surprised at this request,
replied gently: &quot;My good man, that which you ask is impossible. Of what
use would my alms be if I treated you so ill?&quot; And as he spoke he tried to
loosen the grasp of the blind beggar. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; answered the man,
&quot;pardon my boldness and my persistence. Take back your money, or give me
the blow which I crave. I have sworn a solemn oath that I will receive nothing
without receiving chastisement, and if you knew all, you would feel that the
punishment is not a tenth part of what I deserve.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Moved by these words, and perhaps still more by
the fact that he had other business to attend to, the Caliph yielded, and
struck him lightly on the shoulder. Then he continued his road, followed by the
blessing of the blind man. When they were out of earshot, he said to the vizir,
&quot;There must be something very odd to make that man act so--I should like
to find out what is the reason. Go back to him; tell him who I am, and order
him to come without fail to the palace to-morrow, after the hour of evening
prayer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the grand-vizir went back to the bridge; gave
the blind beggar first a piece of money and then a blow, delivered the Caliph's
message, and rejoined his master. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They passed on towards the palace, but walking
through a square, they came upon a crowd watching a young and well-dressed man
who was urging a horse at full speed round the open space, using at the same
time his spurs and whip so unmercifully that the animal was all covered with
foam and blood. The Caliph, astonished at this proceeding, inquired of a
passer-by what it all meant, but no one could tell him anything, except that
every day at the same hour the same thing took place. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Still wondering, he passed on, and for the
moment had to content himself with telling the vizir to command the horseman
also to appear before him at the same time as the blind man. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day, after evening prayer, the Caliph
entered the hall, and was followed by the vizir bringing with him the two men
of whom we have spoken, and a third, with whom we have nothing to do. They all
bowed themselves low before the throne and then the Caliph bade them rise, and
ask the blind man his name. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Baba-Abdalla, your Highness,&quot; said
he. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Baba-Abdalla,&quot; returned the Caliph,
&quot;your way of asking alms yesterday seemed to me so strange, that I almost
commanded you then and there to cease from causing such a public scandal. But I
have sent for you to inquire what was your motive in making such a curious vow.
When I know the reason I shall be able to judge whether you can be permitted to
continue to practise it, for I cannot help thinking that it sets a very bad
example to others. Tell me therefore the whole truth, and conceal nothing.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These words troubled the heart of Baba-Abdalla,
who prostrated himself at the feet of the Caliph. Then rising, he answered:
&quot;Commander of the Faithful, I crave your pardon humbly, for my persistence
in beseeching your Highness to do an action which appears on the face of it to
be without any meaning. No doubt, in the eyes of men, it has none; but I look
on it as a slight expiation for a fearful sin of which I have been guilty, and
if your Highness will deign to listen to my tale, you will see that no
punishment could atone for the crime.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%'>The Story of the Blind Baba-Abdalla</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was born, Commander of the Faithful, in
Bagdad, and was left an orphan while I was yet a very young man, for my parents
died within a few days of each other. I had inherited from them a small
fortune, which I worked hard night and day to increase, till at last I found
myself the owner of eighty camels. These I hired out to travelling merchants,
whom I frequently accompanied on their various journeys, and always returned
with large profits. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither
I had taken a supply of goods, intended for India, and halted at noon in a
lonely place, which promised rich pasture for my camels. I was resting in the
shade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora, sat down by
my side, and I inquired whence he had come and to what place he was going. We
soon made friends, and after we had asked each other the usual questions, we
produced the food we had with us, and satisfied our hunger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While we were eating, the dervish happened to
mention that in a spot only a little way off from where we were sitting, there
was hidden a treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they
could carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full as if it had never
been touched. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this news I became almost beside myself with
joy and greed, and I flung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming:
&quot;Good dervish, I see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to
you, therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you? Alone and
on foot, you could carry away a mere handful. But tell me where it is, and I
will load my eighty camels with it, and give you one of them as a token of my
gratitude.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Certainly my offer does not sound very
magnificent, but it was great to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness
had swept over my heart, and I almost felt as if the seventy-nine camels that
were left were nothing in comparison. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervish saw quite well what was passing in
my mind, but he did not show what he thought of my proposal. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother,&quot; he answered quietly,
&quot;you know as well as I do, that you are behaving unjustly. It was open to
me to keep my secret, and to reserve the treasure for myself. But the fact that
I have told you of its existence shows that I had confidence in you, and that I
hoped to earn your gratitude for ever, by making your fortune as well as mine.
But before I reveal to you the secret of the treasure, you must swear that,
after we have loaded the camels with as much as they can carry, you will give
half to me, and let us go our own ways. I think you will see that this is fair,
for if you present me with forty camels, I on my side will give you the means
of buying a thousand more.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I could not of course deny that what the dervish
said was perfectly reasonable, but, in spite of that, the thought that the
dervish would be as rich as I was unbearable to me. Still there was no use in discussing
the matter, and I had to accept his conditions or bewail to the end of my life
the loss of immense wealth. So I collected my camels and we set out together
under the guidance of the dervish. After walking some time, we reached what
looked like a valley, but with such a narrow entrance that my camels could only
pass one by one. The little valley, or open space, was shut up by two
mountains, whose sides were formed of straight cliffs, which no human being
could climb. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When we were exactly between these mountains the
dervish stopped. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Make your camels lie down in this open
space,&quot; he said, &quot;so that we can easily load them; then we will go to
the treasure.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I did what I was bid, and rejoined the dervish,
whom I found trying to kindle a fire out of some dry wood. As soon as it was
alight, he threw on it a handful of perfumes, and pronounced a few words that I
did not understand, and immediately a thick column of smoke rose high into the
air. He separated the smoke into two columns, and then I saw a rock, which
stood like a pillar between the two mountains, slowly open, and a splendid
palace appear within. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But, Commander of the Faithful, the love of gold
had taken such possession of my heart, that I could not even stop to examine
the riches, but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reach and began to
heap it into a sack that I had brought with me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervish likewise set to work, but I soon
noticed that he confined himself to collecting precious stones, and I felt I
should be wise to follow his example. At length the camels were loaded with as
much as they could carry, and nothing remained but to seal up the treasure, and
go our ways. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before, however, this was done, the dervish went
up to a great golden vase, beautifully chased, and took from it a small wooden
box, which he hid in the bosom of his dress, merely saying that it contained a
special kind of ointment. Then he once more kindled the fire, threw on the
perfume, and murmured the unknown spell, and the rock closed, and stood whole
as before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next thing was to divide the camels, and to
charge them with the treasure, after which we each took command of our own and
marched out of the valley, till we reached the place in the high road where the
routes diverge, and then we parted, the dervish going towards Balsora, and I to
Bagdad. We embraced each other tenderly, and I poured out my gratitude for the
honour he had done me, in singling me out for this great wealth, and having
said a hearty farewell we turned our backs, and hastened after our camels. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had hardly come up with mine when the demon of
envy filled my soul. &quot;What does a dervish want with riches like
that?&quot; I said to myself. &quot;He alone has the secret of the treasure,
and can always get as much as he wants,&quot; and I halted my camels by the
roadside, and ran back after him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was a quick runner, and it did not take me
very long to come up with him. &quot;My brother,&quot; I exclaimed, as soon as
I could speak, &quot;almost at the moment of our leave-taking, a reflection
occurred to me, which is perhaps new to you. You are a dervish by profession,
and live a very quiet life, only caring to do good, and careless of the things
of this world. You do not realise the burden that you lay upon yourself, when
you gather into your hands such great wealth, besides the fact that no one, who
is not accustomed to camels from his birth, can ever manage the stubborn
beasts. If you are wise, you will not encumber yourself with more than thirty,
and you will find those trouble enough.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are right,&quot; replied the dervish,
who understood me quite well, but did not wish to fight the matter. &quot;I
confess I had not thought about it. Choose any ten you like, and drive them
before you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I selected ten of the best camels, and we
proceeded along the road, to rejoin those I had left behind. I had got what I
wanted, but I had found the dervish so easy to deal with, that I rather
regretted I had not asked for ten more. I looked back. He had only gone a few
paces, and I called after him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother,&quot; I said, &quot;I am
unwilling to part from you without pointing out what I think you scarcely
grasp, that large experience of camel-driving is necessary to anybody who
intends to keep together a troop of thirty. In your own interest, I feel sure
you would be much happier if you entrusted ten more of them to me, for with my
practice it is all one to me if I take two or a hundred.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As before, the dervish made no difficulties, and
I drove off my ten camels in triumph, only leaving him with twenty for his
share. I had now sixty, and anyone might have imagined that I should be
content. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But, Commander of the Faithful, there is a
proverb that says, &quot;the more one has, the more one wants.&quot; So it was
with me. I could not rest as long as one solitary camel remained to the
dervish; and returning to him I redoubled my prayers and embraces, and promises
of eternal gratitude, till the last twenty were in my hands. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Make a good use of them, my brother,&quot;
said the holy man. &quot;Remember riches sometimes have wings if we keep them
for ourselves, and the poor are at our gates expressly that we may help
them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>My eyes were so blinded by gold, that I paid no
heed to his wise counsel, and only looked about for something else to grasp.
Suddenly I remembered the little box of ointment that the dervish had hidden,
and which most likely contained a treasure more precious than all the rest.
Giving him one last embrace, I observed accidentally, &quot;What are you going
to do with that little box of ointment? It seems hardly worth taking with you;
you might as well let me have it. And really, a dervish who has given up the
world has no need of ointment!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Oh, if he had only refused my request! But then,
supposing he had, I should have got possession of it by force, so great was the
madness that had laid hold upon me. However, far from refusing it, the dervish
at once held it out, saying gracefully, &quot;Take it, my friend, and if there
is anything else I can do to make you happy you must let me know.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Directly the box was in my hands I wrenched off
the cover. &quot;As you are so kind,&quot; I said, &quot;tell me, I pray you,
what are the virtues of this ointment?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;They are most curious and
interesting,&quot; replied the dervish. &quot;If you apply a little of it to
your left eye you will behold in an instant all the treasures hidden in the
bowels of the earth. But beware lest you touch your right eye with it, or your
sight will be destroyed for ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His words excited my curiosity to the highest
pitch. &quot;Make trial on me, I implore you,&quot; I cried, holding out the
box to the dervish. &quot;You will know how to do it better than I! I am
burning with impatience to test its charms.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervish took the box I had extended to him,
and, bidding me shut my left eye, touched it gently with the ointment. When I
opened it again I saw spread out, as it were before me, treasures of every kind
and without number. But as all this time I had been obliged to keep my right
eye closed, which was very fatiguing, I begged the dervish to apply the ointment
to that eye also. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you insist upon it I will do it,&quot;
answered the dervish, &quot;but you must remember what I told you just
now--that if it touches your right eye you will become blind on the spot.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Unluckily, in spite of my having proved the
truth of the dervish's words in so many instances, I was firmly convinced that
he was now keeping concealed from me some hidden and precious virtue of the
ointment. So I turned a deaf ear to all he said. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother,&quot; I replied smiling,
&quot;I see you are joking. It is not natural that the same ointment should
have two such exactly opposite effects.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is true all the same,&quot; answered
the dervish, &quot;and it would be well for you if you believed my word.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But I would not believe, and, dazzled by the
greed of avarice, I thought that if one eye could show me riches, the other
might teach me how to get possession of them. And I continued to press the
dervish to anoint my right eye, but this he resolutely declined to do. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;After having conferred such benefits on
you,&quot; said he, &quot;I am loth indeed to work you such evil. Think what it
is to be blind, and do not force me to do what you will repent as long as you
live.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was of no use. &quot;My brother,&quot; I said
firmly, &quot;pray say no more, but do what I ask. You have most generously responded
to my wishes up to this time, do not spoil my recollection of you for a thing
of such little consequence. Let what will happen I take it on my own head, and
will never reproach you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Since you are determined upon it,&quot; he
answered with a sigh, &quot;there is no use talking,&quot; and taking the
ointment he laid some on my right eye, which was tight shut. When I tried to
open it heavy clouds of darkness floated before me. I was as blind as you see
me now! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Miserable dervish!&quot; I shrieked,
&quot;so it is true after all! Into what a bottomless pit has my lust after
gold plunged me. Ah, now that my eyes are closed they are really opened. I know
that all my sufferings are caused by myself alone! But, good brother, you, who
are so kind and charitable, and know the secrets of such vast learning, have
you nothing that will give me back my sight?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Unhappy man,&quot; replied the dervish,
&quot;it is not my fault that this has befallen you, but it is a just
chastisement. The blindness of your heart has wrought the blindness of your body.
Yes, I have secrets; that you have seen in the short time that we have known
each other. But I have none that will give you back your sight. You have proved
yourself unworthy of the riches that were given you. Now they have passed into
my hands, whence they will flow into the hands of others less greedy and
ungrateful than you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervish said no more and left me, speechless
with shame and confusion, and so wretched that I stood rooted to the spot,
while he collected the eighty camels and proceeded on his way to Balsora. It
was in vain that I entreated him not to leave me, but at least to take me
within reach of the first passing caravan. He was deaf to my prayers and cries,
and I should soon have been dead of hunger and misery if some merchants had not
come along the track the following day and kindly brought me back to Bagdad. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From a rich man I had in one moment become a
beggar; and up to this time I have lived solely on the alms that have been
bestowed on me. But, in order to expiate the sin of avarice, which was my
undoing, I oblige each passer-by to give me a blow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

addressed him: &quot;Baba-Abdalla, truly your sin is great, but you have
suffered enough. Henceforth repent in private, for I will see that enough money
is given you day by day for all your wants.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, was much pleased
with the tale of the blind man and the dervish, and when it was finished he
turned to the young man who had ill-treated his horse, and inquired his name
also. The young man replied that he was called Sidi-Nouman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sidi-Nouman,&quot; observed the Caliph,
&quot;I have seen horses broken all my life long, and have even broken them
myself, but I have never seen any horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by
you yesterday. Every one who looked on was indignant, and blamed you loudly. As
for myself, I was so angry that I was very nearly disclosing who I was, and
putting a stop to it at once. Still, you have not the air of a cruel man, and I
would gladly believe that you did not act in this way without some reason. As I
am told that it was not the first time, and indeed that every day you are to be
seen flogging and spurring your horse, I wish to come to the bottom of the
matter. But tell me the whole truth, and conceal nothing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Sidi-Nouman changed colour as he heard these
words, and his manner grew confused; but he saw plainly that there was no help
for it. So he prostrated himself before the throne of the Caliph and tried to
obey, but the words stuck in his throat, and he remained silent. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph, accustomed though he was to instant
obedience, guessed something of what was passing in the young man's mind, and
sought to put him at his ease. &quot;Sidi-Nouman,&quot; he said, &quot;do not
think of me as the Caliph, but merely as a friend who would like to hear your
story. If there is anything in it that you are afraid may offend me, take
courage, for I pardon you beforehand. Speak then openly and without fear, as to
one who knows and loves you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Reassured by the kindness of the Caliph,
Sidi-Nouman at length began his tale. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; said he,
&quot;dazzled though I am by the lustre of your Highness' presence, I will do
my best to satisfy your wishes. I am by no means perfect, but I am not
naturally cruel, neither do I take pleasure in breaking the law. I admit that
the treatment of my horse is calculated to give your Highness a bad opinion of
me, and to set an evil example to others; yet I have not chastised it without
reason, and I have hopes that I shall be judged more worthy of pity than
punishment.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Commander of the Faithful, I will not trouble to
describe my birth; it is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your
Highness' attention. My ancestors were careful people, and I inherited enough
money to enable me to live comfortably, though without show. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having therefore a modest fortune, the only
thing wanting to my happiness was a wife who could return my affection, but
this blessing I was not destined to get; for on the very day after my marriage,
my bride began to try my patience in every way that was most hard to bear. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now, seeing that the customs of our land oblige
us to marry without ever beholding the person with whom we are to pass our
lives, a man has of course no right to complain as long as his wife is not
absolutely repulsive, or is not positively deformed. And whatever defects her
body may have, pleasant ways and good behaviour will go far to remedy them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she
had been brought to my house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to find
that I had not been deceived in regard to the account that had been given me of
her beauty. I began my married life in high spirits, and the best hopes of
happiness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The following day a grand dinner was served to
us but as my wife did not appear, I ordered a servant to call her. Still she
did not come, and I waited impatiently for some time. At last she entered the
room, and she took our places at the table, and plates of rice were set before
us. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but
great was my surprise to notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew
from her pocket a little case, from which she selected a long pin, and by the
help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Amina,&quot; I exclaimed in astonishment,
&quot;is that the way you eat rice at home? And did you do it because your
appetite was so small, or did you wish to count the grains so that you might
never eat more than a certain number? If it was from economy, and you are
anxious to teach me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for alarm. We shall
never ruin ourselves in that way! Our fortune is large enough for all our
needs, therefore, dear Amina, do not seek to check yourself, but eat as much as
you desire, as I do!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In reply to my affectionate words, I expected a
cheerful answer; yet Amina said nothing at all, but continued to pick her rice
as before, only at longer and longer intervals. And, instead of trying the
other dishes, all she did was to put every now and then a crumb, of bread into
her mouth, that would not have made a meal for a sparrow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I felt provoked by her obstinacy, but to excuse
her to myself as far as I could, I suggested that perhaps she had never been
used to eat in the company of men, and that her family might have taught her
that she ought to behave prudently and discreetly in the presence of her
husband. Likewise that she might either have dined already or intend to do so
in her own apartments. So I took no further notice, and when I had finished
left the room, secretly much vexed at her strange conduct. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The same thing occurred at supper, and all
through the next day, whenever we ate together. It was quite clear that no
woman could live upon two or three bread-crumbs and a few grains of rice, and I
determined to find out how and when she got food. I pretended not to pay
attention to anything she did, in the hope that little by little she would get
accustomed to me, and become more friendly; but I soon saw that my expectations
were quite vain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One night I was lying with my eyes closed, and
to, all appearance sound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself
without making the slightest sound. I could not imagine what she was going to
do, and as my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her. When she was
fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The instant she had let the curtain fall behind
her, I flung a garment on my shoulders and a pair of slippers on my feet.
Looking from a lattice which opened into the court, I saw her in the act of
passing through the street door, which she carefully left open. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was bright moonlight, so I easily managed to
keep her in sight, till she entered a cemetery not far from the house. There I
hid myself under the shadow of the wall, and crouched down cautiously; and
hardly was I concealed, when I saw my wife approaching in company with a
ghoul--one of those demons which, as your Highness is aware, wander about the
country making their lairs in deserted buildings and springing out upon unwary travellers
whose flesh they eat. If no live being goes their way, they then betake
themselves to the cemeteries, and feed upon the dead bodies. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was nearly struck dumb with horror on seeing
my wife with this hideous female ghoul. They passed by me without noticing me,
began to dig up a corpse which had been buried that day, and then sat down on
the edge of the grave, to enjoy their frightful repast, talking quietly and
cheerfully all the while, though I was too far off to hear what they said. When
they had finished, they threw back the body into the grave, and heaped back the
earth upon it. I made no effort to disturb them, and returned quickly to the
house, when I took care to leave the door open, as I had previously found it.
Then I got back into bed, and pretended to sleep soundly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A short time after Amina entered as quietly as
she had gone out. She undressed and stole into bed, congratulating herself
apparently on the cleverness with which she had managed her expedition. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As may be guessed, after such a scene it was
long before I could close my eyes, and at the first sound which called the
faithful to prayer, I put on my clothes and went to the mosque. But even prayer
did not restore peace to my troubled spirit, and I could not face my wife until
I had made up my mind what future course I should pursue in regard to her. I
therefore spent the morning roaming about from one garden to another, turning
over various plans for compelling my wife to give up her horrible ways; I
thought of using violence to make her submit, but felt reluctant to be unkind
to her. Besides, I had an instinct that gentle means had the best chance of
success; so, a little soothed, I turned towards home, which I reached about the
hour of dinner. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as I appeared, Amina ordered dinner to
be served, and we sat down together. As usual, she persisted in only picking a
few grains of rice, and I resolved to speak to her at once of what lay so
heavily on my heart. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Amina,&quot; I said, as quietly as
possible, &quot;you must have guessed the surprise I felt, when the day after
our marriage you declined to eat anything but a few morsels of rice, and
altogether behaved in such a manner that most husbands would have been deeply
wounded. However I had patience with you, and only tried to tempt your appetite
by the choicest dishes I could invent, but all to no purpose. Still, Amina, it
seems to me that there be some among them as sweet to the taste as the flesh of
a corpse?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I had no sooner uttered these words than Amina,
who instantly understood that I had followed her to the grave-yard, was seized
with a passion beyond any that I have ever witnessed. Her face became purple,
her eyes looked as if they would start from her head, and she positively foamed
with rage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I watched her with terror, wondering what would
happen next, but little thinking what would be the end of her fury. She seized
a vessel of water that stood at hand, and plunging her hand in it, murmured
some words I failed to catch. Then, sprinkling it on my face, she cried madly: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wretch, receive the reward of your prying,
and become a dog.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The words were not out of her mouth when,
without feeling conscious that any change was passing over me, I suddenly knew
that I had ceased to be a man. In the greatness of the shock and surprise--for
I had no idea that Amina was a magician--I never dreamed of running away, and
stood rooted to the spot, while Amina grasped a stick and began to beat me.
Indeed her blows were so heavy, that I only wonder they did not kill me at
once. However they succeeded in rousing me from my stupor, and I dashed into
the court-yard, followed closely by Amina, who made frantic dives at me, which
I was not quick enough to dodge. At last she got tired of pursuing me, or else
a new trick entered into her head, which would give me speedy and painful
death; she opened the gate leading into the street, intending to crush me as I
passed through. Dog though I was, I saw through her design, and stung into
presence of mind by the greatness of the danger, I timed my movements so well
that I contrived to rush through, and only the tip of my tail received a
squeeze as she banged the gate. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I was safe, but my tail hurt me horribly, and I
yelped and howled so loud all along the streets, that the other dogs came and
attacked me, which made matters no better. In order to avoid them, I took
refuge in a cookshop, where tongues and sheep's heads were sold. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At first the owner showed me great kindness, and
drove away the other dogs that were still at my heels, while I crept into the
darkest corner. But though I was safe for the moment, I was not destined to
remain long under his protection, for he was one of those who hold all dogs to
be unclean, and that all the washing in the world will hardly purify you from
their contact. So after my enemies had gone to seek other prey, he tried to
lure me from my corner in order to force me into the street. But I refused to
come out of my hole, and spent the night in sleep, which I sorely needed, after
the pain inflicted on me by Amina. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I have no wish to weary your Highness by
dwelling on the sad thoughts which accompanied my change of shape, but it may
interest you to hear that the next morning my host went out early to do his
marketing, and returned laden with the sheep's heads, and tongues and trotters
that formed his stock in trade for the day. The smell of meat attracted various
hungry dogs in the neighbourhood, and they gathered round the door begging for
some bits. I stole out of my corner, and stood with them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In spite of his objection to dogs, as unclean
animals, my protector was a kind-hearted man, and knowing I had eaten nothing
since yesterday, he threw me bigger and better bits than those which fell to
the share of the other dogs. When I had finished, I tried to go back into the
shop, but this he would not allow, and stood so firmly at the entrance with a
stout stick, that I was forced to give it up, and seek some other home. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A few paces further on was a baker's shop, which
seemed to have a gay and merry man for a master. At that moment he was having
his breakfast, and though I gave no signs of hunger, he at once threw me a
piece of bread. Before gobbling it up, as most dogs are in the habit of doing,
I bowed my head and wagged my tail, in token of thanks, and he understood, and
smiled pleasantly. I really did not want the bread at all, but felt it would be
ungracious to refuse, so I ate it slowly, in order that he might see that I
only did it out of politeness. He understood this also, and seemed quite
willing to let me stay in his shop, so I sat down, with my face to the door, to
show that I only asked his protection. This he gave me, and indeed encouraged
me to come into the house itself, giving me a corner where I might sleep,
without being in anybody's way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The kindness heaped on me by this excellent man
was far greater than I could ever have expected. He was always affectionate in
his manner of treating me, and I shared his breakfast, dinner and supper,
while, on my side, I gave him all the gratitude and attachment to which he had
a right. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>I sat with my eyes fixed on him, and he never
left the house without having me at his heels; and if it ever happened that
when he was preparing to go out I was asleep, and did not notice, he would call
&quot;Rufus, Rufus,&quot; for that was the name he gave me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some weeks passed in this way, when one day a
woman came in to buy bread. In paying for it, she laid down several pieces of
money, one of which was bad. The baker perceived this, and declined to take it,
demanding another in its place. The woman, for her part, refused to take it
back, declaring it was perfectly good, but the baker would have nothing to do
with it. &quot;It is really such a bad imitation,&quot; he exclaimed at last,
&quot;that even my dog would not be taken in. Here Rufus! Rufus!&quot; and
hearing his voice, I jumped on to the counter. The baker threw down the money
before me, and said, &quot;Find out if there is a bad coin.&quot; I looked at
each in turn, and then laid my paw on the false one, glancing at the same time
at my master, so as to point it out. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The baker, who had of course been only in joke,
was exceedingly surprised at my cleverness, and the woman, who was at last
convinced that the man spoke the truth, produced another piece of money in its
place. When she had gone, my master was so pleased that he told all the
neighbours what I had done, and made a great deal more of it than there really
was. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The neighbours, very naturally, declined to
believe his story, and tried me several times with all the bad money they could
collect together, but I never failed to stand the test triumphantly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon, the shop was filled from morning till
night, with people who on the pretence of buying bread came to see if I was as
clever as I was reported to be. The baker drove a roaring trade, and admitted
that I was worth my weight in gold to him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Of course there were plenty who envied him his
large custom, and many was the pitfall set for me, so that he never dared to
let me out of his sight. One day a woman, who had not been in the shop before,
came to ask for bread, like the rest. As usual, I was lying on the counter, and
she threw down six coins before me, one of which was false. I detected it at
once, and put my paw on it, looking as I did so at the woman. &quot;Yes,&quot;
she said, nodding her head. &quot;You are quite right, that is the one.&quot;
She stood gazing at me attentively for some time, then paid for the bread, and
left the shop, making a sign for me to follow her secretly. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now my thoughts were always running on some
means of shaking off the spell laid on me, and noticing the way in which this
woman had looked at me, the idea entered my head that perhaps she might have
guessed what had happened, and in this I was not deceived. However I let her go
on a little way, and merely stood at the door watching her. She turned, and seeing
that I was quite still, she again beckoned to me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The baker all this while was busy with his oven,
and had forgotten all about me, so I stole out softly, and ran after the woman.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When we came to her house, which was some
distance off, she opened the door and then said to me, &quot;Come in, come in;
you will never be sorry that you followed me.&quot; When I had entered she
fastened the door, and took me into a large room, where a beautiful girl was
working at a piece of embroidery. &quot;My daughter,&quot; exclaimed my guide,
&quot;I have brought you the famous dog belonging to the baker which can tell
good money from bad. You know that when I first heard of him, I told you I was
sure he must be really a man, changed into a dog by magic. To-day I went to the
baker's, to prove for myself the truth of the story, and persuaded the dog to
follow me here. Now what do you say?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are right, mother,&quot; replied the
girl, and rising she dipped her hand into a vessel of water. Then sprinkling it
over me she said, &quot;If you were born dog, remain dog; but if you were born
man, by virtue of this water resume your proper form.&quot; In one moment the
spell was broken. The dog's shape vanished as if it had never been, and it was
a man who stood before her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Overcome with gratitude at my deliverance, I
flung myself at her feet, and kissed the hem of her garment. &quot;How can I
thank you for your goodness towards a stranger, and for what you have done?
Henceforth I am your slave. Deal with me as you will!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then, in order to explain how I came to be changed
into a dog, I told her my whole story, and finished with rendering the mother
the thanks due to her for the happiness she had brought me. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sidi-Nouman,&quot; returned the daughter,
&quot;say no more about the obligation you are under to us. The knowledge that
we have been of service to you is ample payment. Let us speak of Amina, your
wife, with whom I was acquainted before her marriage. I was aware that she was
a magician, and she knew too that I had studied the same art, under the same
mistress. We met often going to the same baths, but we did not like each other,
and never sought to become friends. As to what concerns you, it is not enough
to have broken your spell, she must be punished for her wickedness. Remain for
a moment with my mother, I beg,&quot; she added hastily, &quot;I will return
shortly.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Left alone with the mother, I again expressed
the gratitude I felt, to her as well as to her daughter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My daughter,&quot; she answered, &quot;is,
as you see, as accomplished a magician as Amina herself, but you would be
astonished at the amount of good she does by her knowledge. That is why I have
never interfered, otherwise I should have put a stop to it long ago.&quot; As
she spoke, her daughter entered with a small bottle in her hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sidi-Nouman,&quot; she said, &quot;the
books I have just consulted tell me that Amina is not home at present, but she
should return at any moment. I have likewise found out by their means, that she
pretends before the servants great uneasiness as to your absence. She has
circulated a story that, while at dinner with her, you remembered some
important business that had to be done at once, and left the house without
shutting the door. By this means a dog had strayed in, which she was forced to
get rid of by a stick. Go home then without delay, and await Amina's return in
your room. When she comes in, go down to meet her, and in her surprise, she
will try to run away. Then have this bottle ready, and dash the water it
contains over her, saying boldly, &quot;Receive the reward of your
crimes.&quot; That is all I have to tell you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Everything happened exactly as the young
magician had foretold. I had not been in my house many minutes before Amina
returned, and as she approached I stepped in front of her, with the water in my
hand. She gave one loud cry, and turned to the door, but she was too late. I
had already dashed the water in her face and spoken the magic words. Amina
disappeared, and in her place stood the horse you saw me beating yesterday. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story,
and may I venture to hope that, now you have heard the reason of my conduct,
your Highness will not think this wicked woman too harshly treated? </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sidi-Nouman,&quot; replied the Caliph,
&quot;your story is indeed a strange one, and there is no excuse to be offered
for your wife. But, without condemning your treatment of her, I wish you to
reflect how much she must suffer from being changed into an animal, and I hope
you will let that punishment be enough. I do not order you to insist upon the
young magician finding the means to restore your wife to her human shape,
because I know that when once women such as she begin to work evil they never
leave off, and I should only bring down on your head a vengeance far worse than
the one you have undergone already.&quot;</span></p>

Bagdad</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived
in Bagdad a merchant named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child,
contented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade. He had spent
some years quite happily in the house his father had left him, when three
nights running he dreamed that an old man had appeared to him, and reproached
him for having neglected the duty of a good Mussulman, in delaying so long his
pilgrimage to Mecca. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia was much troubled by this dream, as he
was unwilling to give up his shop, and lose all his customers. He had shut his
eyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage, and tried to
atone to his conscience by an extra number of good works, but the dream seemed
to him a direct warning, and he resolved to put the journey off no longer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The first thing he did was to sell his furniture
and the wares he had in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as he
might trade with on the road. The shop itself he sold also, and easily found a
tenant for his private house. The only matter he could not settle
satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand pieces of gold which he
wished to leave behind him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After some thought, Ali Cogia hit upon a plan
which seemed a safe one. He took a large vase, and placing the money in the
bottom of it, filled up the rest with olives. After corking the vase tightly
down, he carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like himself, and said to
him: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My brother, you have probably heard that I
am staffing with a caravan in a few days for Mecca. I have come to ask whether
you would do me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I come
back?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant replied readily, &quot;Look, this
is the key of my shop: take it, and put the vase wherever you like. I promise
that you shall find it in the same place on your return.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A few days later, Ali Cogia mounted the camel
that he had laden with merchandise, joined the caravan, and arrived in due time
at Mecca. Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque, and after all
his religious duties were performed, he set out his goods to the best
advantage, hoping to gain some customers among the passers-by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Very soon two merchants stopped before the pile,
and when they had turned it over, one said to the other: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If this man was wise he would take these
things to Cairo, where he would get a much better price than he is likely to do
here.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia heard the words, and lost no time in
following the advice. He packed up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad,
joined a caravan that was going to Cairo. The results of the journey gladdened
his heart. He sold off everything almost directly, and bought a stock of
Egyptian curiosities, which he intended selling at Damascus; but as the caravan
with which he would have to travel would not be starting for another six weeks,
he took advantage of the delay to visit the Pyramids, and some of the cities
along the banks of the Nile. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the attractions of Damascus so fascinated
the worthy Ali, that he could hardly tear himself away, but at length he
remembered that he had a home in Bagdad, meaning to return by way of Aleppo,
and after he had crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course of the Tigris. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such
friends with some Persian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany them
to their native land, and even as far as India, and so it came to pass that
seven years had slipped by since he had left Bagdad, and during all that time
the friend with whom he had left the vase of olives had never once thought of
him or of it. In fact, it was only a month before Ali Cogia's actual return
that the affair came into his head at all, owing to his wife's remarking one
day, that it was a long time since she had eaten any olives, and would like
some. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That reminds me,&quot; said the husband,
&quot;that before Ali Cogia went to Mecca seven years ago, he left a vase of
olives in my care. But really by this time he must be dead, and there is no
reason we should not eat the olives if we like. Give me a light, and I will
fetch them and see how they taste.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My husband,&quot; answered the wife,
&quot;beware, I pray, of your doing anything so base! Supposing seven years
have passed without news of Ali Cogia, he need not be dead for all that, and
may come back any day. How shameful it would be to have to confess that you had
betrayed your trust and broken the seal of the vase! Pay no attention to my
idle words, I really have no desire for olives now. And probably after all this
while they are no longer good. I have a presentiment that Ali Cogia will
return, and what will he think of you? Give it up, I entreat.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, however, refused to listen to her
advice, sensible though it was. He took a light and a dish and went into his
shop. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you will be so obstinate,&quot; said
his wife, &quot;I cannot help it; but do not blame me if it turns out
ill.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the merchant opened the vase he found the
topmost olives were rotten, and in order to see if the under ones were in
better condition he shook some out into the dish. As they fell out a few of the
gold pieces fell out too. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sight of the money roused all the merchant's
greed. He looked into the vase, and saw that all the bottom was filled with
gold. He then replaced the olives and returned to his wife. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My wife,&quot; he said, as he entered the
room, &quot;you were quite right; the olives are rotten, and I have recorked
the vase so well that Ali Cogia will never know it has been touched.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You would have done better to believe
me,&quot; replied the wife. &quot;I trust that no harm will come of it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These words made no more impression on the
merchant than the others had done; and he spent the whole night in wondering
how he could manage to keep the gold if Ali Cogia should come back and claim
his vase. Very early next morning he went out and bought fresh new olives; he
then threw away the old ones, took out the gold and hid it, and filled up the
vase with the olives he had bought. This done he recorked the vase and put it
in the same place where it had been left by Ali Cogia. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A month later Ali Cogia re-entered Bagdad, and
as his house was still let he went to an inn; and the following day set out to
see his friend the merchant, who received him with open arms and many
expressions of surprise. After a few moments given to inquiries Ali Cogia begged
the merchant to hand him over the vase that he had taken care of for so long. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh certainly,&quot; said he, &quot;I am
only glad I could be of use to you in the matter. Here is the key of my shop;
you will find the vase in the place where you put it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his
room at the inn, where he opened it. He thrust down his hand but could feel no
money, but still was persuaded it must be there. So he got some plates and
vessels from his travelling kit and emptied out the olives. To no purpose. The
gold was not there. The poor man was dumb with horror, then, lifting up his
hands, he exclaimed, &quot;Can my old friend really have committed such a
crime?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In great haste he went back to the house of the
merchant. &quot;My friend,&quot; he cried, &quot;you will be astonished to see
me again, but I can find nowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I
placed in the bottom under the olives. Perhaps you may have taken a loan of
them for your business purposes; if that is so you are most welcome. I will
only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay the money at your
leisure.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, who had expected something of the
sort, had his reply all ready. &quot;Ali Cogia,&quot; he said, &quot;when you
brought me the vase of olives did I ever touch it?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I gave you the key of my shop and you put
it yourself where you liked, and did you not find it in exactly the same spot
and in the same state? If you placed any gold in it, it must be there still. I
know nothing about that; you only told me there were olives. You can believe me
or not, but I have not laid a finger on the vase.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia still tried every means to persuade
the merchant to admit the truth. &quot;I love peace,&quot; he said, &quot;and
shall deeply regret having to resort to harsh measures. Once more, think of your
reputation. I shall be in despair if you oblige me to call in the aid of the
law.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ali Cogia,&quot; answered the merchant,
&quot;you allow that it was a vase of olives you placed in my charge. You
fetched it and removed it yourself, and now you tell me it contained a thousand
pieces of gold, and that I must restore them to you! Did you ever say anything
about them before? Why, I did not even know that the vase had olives in it! You
never showed them to me. I wonder you have not demanded pearls or diamonds.
Retire, I pray you, lest a crowd should gather in front of my shop.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By this time not only the casual passers-by, but
also the neighbouring merchants, were standing round, listening to the dispute,
and trying every now and then to smooth matters between them. But at the
merchant's last words Ali Cogia resolved to lay the cause of the quarrel before
them, and told them the whole story. They heard him to the end, and inquired of
the merchant what he had to say. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The accused man admitted that he had kept Ali
Cogia's vase in his shop; but he denied having touched it, and swore that as to
what it contained he only knew what Ali Cogia had told him, and called them all
to witness the insult that had been put upon him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You have brought it on yourself,&quot;
said Ali Cogia, taking him by the arm, &quot;and as you appeal to the law, the
law you shall have! Let us see if you will dare to repeat your story before the
Cadi.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now as a good Mussulman the merchant was
forbidden to refuse this choice of a judge, so he accepted the test, and said
to Ali Cogia, &quot;Very well; I should like nothing better. We shall soon see
which of us is in the right.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the two men presented themselves before the
Cadi, and Ali Cogia again repeated his tale. The Cadi asked what witnesses he
had. Ali Cogia replied that he had not taken this precaution, as he had
considered the man his friend, and up to that time had always found him honest.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The merchant, on his side, stuck to his story,
and offered to swear solemnly that not only had he never stolen the thousand
gold pieces, but that he did not even know they were there. The Cadi allowed
him to take the oath, and pronounced him innocent. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia, furious at having to suffer such a
loss, protested against the verdict, declaring that he would appeal to the
Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, himself. But the Cadi paid no attention to his
threats, and was quite satisfied that he had done what was right. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Judgment being given the merchant returned home
triumphant, and Ali Cogia went back to his inn to draw up a petition to the
Caliph. The next morning he placed himself on the road along which the Caliph
must pass after mid-day prayer, and stretched out his petition to the officer
who walked before the Caliph, whose duty it was to collect such things, and on
entering the palace to hand them to his master. There Haroun-al-Raschid studied
them carefully. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Knowing this custom, Ali Cogia followed the
Caliph into the public hall of the palace, and waited the result. After some
time the officer appeared, and told him that the Caliph had read his petition,
and had appointed an hour the next morning to give him audience. He then
inquired the merchant's address, so that he might be summoned to attend also. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That very evening, the Caliph, with his
grand-vizir Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs, all three disguised, as
was their habit, went out to take a stroll through the town. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Going down one street, the Caliph's attention
was attracted by a noise, and looking through a door which opened into a court
he perceived ten or twelve children playing in the moonlight. He hid himself in
a dark corner, and watched them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let us play at being the Cadi,&quot; said
the brightest and quickest of them all; &quot;I will be the Cadi. Bring before
me Ali Cogia, and the merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of
gold.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The boy's words recalled to the Caliph the
petition he had read that morning, and he waited with interest to see what the
children would do. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The proposal was hailed with joy by the other
children, who had heard a great deal of talk about the matter, and they quickly
settled the part each one was to play. The Cadi took his seat gravely, and an
officer introduced first Ali Cogia, the plaintiff, and then the merchant who
was the defendant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia made a low bow, and pleaded his cause
point by point; concluding by imploring the Cadi not to inflict on him such a
heavy loss. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Cadi having heard his case, turned to the
merchant, and inquired why he had not repaid Ali Cogia the sum in question. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The false merchant repeated the reasons that the
real merchant had given to the Cadi of Bagdad, and also offered to swear that
he had told the truth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Stop a moment!&quot; said the little Cadi,
&quot;before we come to oaths, I should like to examine the vase with the
olives. Ali Cogia,&quot; he added, &quot;have you got the vase with you?&quot;
and finding he had not, the Cadi continued, &quot;Go and get it, and bring it
to me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So Ali Cogia disappeared for an instant, and
then pretended to lay a vase at the feet of the Cadi, declaring it was his
vase, which he had given to the accused for safe custody; and in order to be
quite correct, the Cadi asked the merchant if he recognised it as the same
vase. By his silence the merchant admitted the fact, and the Cadi then
commanded to have the vase opened. Ali Cogia made a movement as if he was
taking off the lid, and the little Cadi on his part made a pretence of peering
into a vase. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What beautiful olives!&quot; he said,
&quot;I should like to taste one,&quot; and pretending to put one in his mouth,
he added, &quot;they are really excellent! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; he went on, &quot;it seems to
me odd that olives seven years old should be as good as that! Send for some
dealers in olives, and let us hear what they say!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Two children were presented to him as olive
merchants, and the Cadi addressed them. &quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, &quot;how
long can olives be kept so as to be pleasant eating?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; replied the merchants,
&quot;however much care is taken to preserve them, they never last beyond the
third year. They lose both taste and colour, and are only fit to be thrown
away.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If that is so,&quot; answered the little
Cadi, &quot;examine this vase, and tell me how long the olives have been in
it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The olive merchants pretended to examine the
olives and taste them; then reported to the Cadi that they were fresh and good.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are mistaken,&quot; said he, &quot;Ali
Cogia declares he put them in that vase seven years ago.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; returned the olive
merchants, &quot;we can assure you that the olives are those of the present
year. And if you consult all the merchants in Bagdad you will not find one to
give a contrary opinion.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The accused merchant opened his mouth as if to
protest, but the Cadi gave him no time. &quot;Be silent,&quot; he said,
&quot;you are a thief. Take him away and hang him.&quot; So the game ended, the
children clapping their hands in applause, and leading the criminal away to be
hanged. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Haroun-al-Raschid was lost in astonishment at
the wisdom of the child, who had given so wise a verdict on the case which he
himself was to hear on the morrow. &quot;Is there any other verdict
possible?&quot; he asked the grand-vizir, who was as much impressed as himself.
&quot;I can imagine no better judgment.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If the circumstances are really such as we
have heard,&quot; replied the grand-vizir, &quot;it seems to me your Highness
could only follow the example of this boy, in the method of reasoning, and also
in your conclusions.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then take careful note of this
house,&quot; said the Caliph, &quot;and bring me the boy to-morrow, so that the
affair may be tried by him in my presence. Summon also the Cadi, to learn his duty
from the mouth of a child. Bid Ali Cogia bring his vase of olives, and see that
two dealers in olives are present.&quot; So saying the Caliph returned to the
palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning early, the grand-vizir went
back to the house where they had seen the children playing, and asked for the
mistress and her children. Three boys appeared, and the grand-vizir inquired
which had represented the Cadi in their game of the previous evening. The
eldest and tallest, changing colour, confessed that it was he, and to his
mother's great alarm, the grand-vizir said that he had strict orders to bring
him into the presence of the Caliph. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Does he want to take my son from me?&quot;
cried the poor woman; but the grand-vizir hastened to calm her, by assuring her
that she should have the boy again in an hour, and she would be quite satisfied
when she knew the reason of the summons. So she dressed the boy in his best
clothes, and the two left the house. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the grand-vizir presented the child to the
Caliph, he was a little awed and confused, and the Caliph proceeded to explain
why he had sent for him. &quot;Approach, my son,&quot; he said kindly. &quot;I
think it was you who judged the case of Ali Cogia and the merchant last night?
I overheard you by chance, and was very pleased with the way you conducted it.
To-day you will see the real Ali Cogia and the real merchant. Seat yourself at
once next to me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Caliph being seated on his throne with the
boy next him, the parties to the suit were ushered in. One by one they
prostrated themselves, and touched the carpet at the foot of the throne with
their foreheads. When they rose up, the Caliph said: &quot;Now speak. This
child will give you justice, and if more should be wanted I will see to it
myself.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ali Cogia and the merchant pleaded one after the
other, but when the merchant offered to swear the same oath that he had taken
before the Cadi, he was stopped by the child, who said that before this was
done he must first see the vase of olives. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At these words, Ali Cogia presented the vase to
the Caliph, and uncovered it. The Caliph took one of the olives, tasted it, and
ordered the expert merchants to do the same. They pronounced the olives good,
and fresh that year. The boy informed them that Ali Cogia declared it was seven
years since he had placed them in the vase; to which they returned the same
answer as the children had done. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The accused merchant saw by this time that his
condemnation was certain, and tried to allege something in his defence. The boy
had too much sense to order him to be hanged, and looked at the Caliph, saying,
&quot;Commander of the Faithful, this is not a game now; it is for your
Highness to condemn him to death and not for me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the Caliph, convinced that the man was a
thief, bade them take him away and hang him, which was done, but not before he
had confessed his guilt and the place in which he had hidden Ali Cogia's money.
The Caliph ordered the Cadi to learn how to deal out justice from the mouth of
a child, and sent the boy home, with a purse containing a hundred pieces of
gold as a mark of his favour. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%'>The Enchanted Horse</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was the Feast of the New Year, the oldest and
most splendid of all the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia, and the day had been
spent by the king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the magnificent
spectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival. The sun was
setting, and the monarch was about to give his court the signal to retire, when
suddenly an Indian appeared before his throne, leading a horse richly
harnessed, and looking in every respect exactly like a real one. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said he, prostrating himself
as he spoke, &quot;although I make my appearance so late before your Highness,
I can confidently assure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the
day can be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes upon
him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I see nothing in it,&quot; replied the
king, &quot;except a clever imitation of a real one; and any skilled workman
might do as much.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; returned the Indian, &quot;it
is not of his outward form that I would speak, but of the use that I can make
of him. I have only to mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and
no matter how distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall find myself
there. It is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous, and if your
Highness will allow me, you can prove it for yourself.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King of Persia, who was interested in every
thing out of the common, and had never before come across a horse with such
qualities, bade the Indian mount the animal, and show what he could do. In an
instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired where the monarch wished
to send him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you see that mountain?&quot; asked the
king, pointing to a huge mass that towered into the sky about three leagues
from Schiraz; &quot;go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the
foot.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The words were hardly out of the king's mouth
when the Indian turned a screw placed in the horse's neck, close to the saddle,
and the animal bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soon beyond the
sight even of the sharpest eyes. In a quarter of an hour the Indian was seen
returning, bearing in his hand the palm, and, guiding his horse to the foot of
the throne, he dismounted, and laid the leaf before the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the monarch had no sooner proved the
astonishing speed of which the horse was capable than he longed to possess it
himself, and indeed, so sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to
sell it, that he looked upon it as his own already. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I never guessed from his mere outside how
valuable an animal he was,&quot; he remarked to the Indian, &quot;and I am
grateful to you for having shown me my error,&quot; said he. &quot;If you will
sell it, name your own price.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the Indian, &quot;I
never doubted that a sovereign so wise and accomplished as your Highness would
do justice to my horse, when he once knew its power; and I even went so far as
to think it probable that you might wish to possess it. Greatly as I prize it,
I will yield it up to your Highness on one condition. The horse was not
constructed by me, but it was given me by the inventor, in exchange for my only
daughter, who made me take a solemn oath that I would never part with it,
except for some object of equal value.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Name anything you like,&quot; cried the
monarch, interrupting him. &quot;My kingdom is large, and filled with fair
cities. You have only to choose which you would prefer, to become its ruler to
the end of your life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the Indian, to whom
the proposal did not seem nearly so generous as it appeared to the king,
&quot;I am most grateful to your Highness for your princely offer, and beseech
you not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse in
exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as
they heard these words, and Prince Firouz Schah, the heir apparent, was filled
with anger at the Indian's presumption. The king, however, thought that it
would not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain such a
delightful toy, and while he was hesitating as to his answer the prince broke
in. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; he said, &quot;it is not
possible that you can doubt for an instant what reply you should give to such
an insolent bargain. Consider what you owe to yourself, and to the blood of
your ancestors.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son,&quot; replied the king, &quot;you
speak nobly, but you do not realise either the value of the horse, or the fact
that if I reject the proposal of the Indian, he will only make the same to some
other monarch, and I should be filled with despair at the thought that anyone
but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World. Of course I do not say
that I shall accept his conditions, and perhaps he may be brought to reason,
but meanwhile I should like you to examine the horse, and, with the owner's
permission, to make trial of its powers.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Indian, who had overheard the king's speech,
thought that he saw in it signs of yielding to his proposal, so he joyfully
agreed to the monarch's wishes, and came forward to help the prince to mount
the horse, and show him how to guide it: but, before he had finished, the young
man turned the screw, and was soon out of sight. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They waited some time, expecting that every
moment he might be seen returning in the distance, but at length the Indian
grew frightened, and prostrating himself before the throne, he said to the
king, &quot;Sire, your Highness must have noticed that the prince, in his
impatience, did not allow me to tell him what it was necessary to do in order
to return to the place from which he started. I implore you not to punish me
for what was not my fault, and not to visit on me any misfortune that may
occur.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But why,&quot; cried the king in a burst
of fear and anger, &quot;why did you not call him back when you saw him disappearing?&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the Indian, &quot;the
rapidity of his movements took me so by surprise that he was out of hearing
before I recovered my speech. But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a
second screw, which will have the effect of bringing the horse back to
earth.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But supposing he does!&quot; answered the
king, &quot;what is to hinder the horse from descending straight into the sea,
or dashing him to pieces on the rocks?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have no fears, your Highness,&quot; said
the Indian; &quot;the horse has the gift of passing over seas, and of carrying
his rider wherever he wishes to go.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, your head shall answer for it,&quot;
returned the monarch, &quot;and if in three months he is not safe back with me,
or at any rate does not send me news of his safety, your life shall pay the
penalty.&quot; So saying, he ordered his guards to seize the Indian and throw
him into prison. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meanwhile, Prince Firouz Schah had gone gaily up
into the air, and for the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and
higher, till the very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains. Then
he began to think it was time to come down, and took for granted that, in order
to do this, it was only needful to turn the screw the reverse way; but, to his
surprise and horror, he found that, turn as he might, he did not make the
smallest impression. He then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he
was to get back to earth again, and understood the danger in which he stood.
Luckily, he did not lose his head, and set about examining the horse's neck
with great care, till at last, to his intense joy, he discovered a tiny little
peg, much smaller than the other, close to the right ear. This he turned, and
found him-self dropping to the earth, though more slowly than he had left it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was now dark, and as the prince could see
nothing, he was obliged, not without some feeling of disquiet, to allow the
horse to direct his own course, and midnight was already passed before Prince
Firouz Schah again touched the ground, faint and weary from his long ride, and
from the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The first thing he did on dismounting was to try
to find out where he was, and, as far as he could discover in the thick
darkness, he found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace, with a
balustrade of marble running round. In one corner of the terrace stood a small
door, opening on to a staircase which led down into the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Some people might have hesitated before
exploring further, but not so the prince. &quot;I am doing no harm,&quot; he
said, &quot;and whoever the owner may be, he will not touch me when he sees I
am unarmed,&quot; and in dread of making a false step, he went cautiously down
the staircase. On a landing, he noticed an open door, beyond which was a
faintly lighted hall. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Before entering, the prince paused and listened,
but he heard nothing except the sound of men snoring. By the light of a lantern
suspended from the roof, he perceived a row of black guards sleeping, each with
a naked sword lying by him, and he understood that the hall must form the
ante-room to the chamber of some queen or princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Standing quite still, Prince Firouz Schah looked
about him, till his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, and he noticed a bright
light shining through a curtain in one corner. He then made his way softly
towards it, and, drawing aside its folds, passed into a magnificent chamber
full of sleeping women, all lying on low couches, except one, who was on a
sofa; and this one, he knew, must be the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Gently stealing up to the side of her bed he
looked at her, and saw that she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever
beheld. But, fascinated though he was, he was well aware of the danger of his
position, as one cry of surprise would awake the guards, and cause his certain
death. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So sinking quietly on his knees, he took hold of
the sleeve of the princess and drew her arm lightly towards him. The princess
opened her eyes, and seeing before her a handsome well-dressed man, she
remained speechless with astonishment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This favourable moment was seized by the prince,
who bowing low while he knelt, thus addressed her: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You behold, madame, a prince in distress,
son to the King of Persia, who, owing to an adventure so strange that you will
scarcely believe it, finds himself here, a suppliant for your protection. But
yesterday, I was in my father's court, engaged in the celebration of our most
solemn festival; to-day, I am in an unknown land, in danger of my life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the princess whose mercy Prince Firouz Schah
implored was the eldest daughter of the King of Bengal, who was enjoying rest
and change in the palace her father had built her, at a little distance from
the capital. She listened kindly to what he had to say, and then answered: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prince, be not uneasy; hospitality and
humanity are practised as widely in Bengal as they are in Persia. The
protection you ask will be given you by all. You have my word for it.&quot; And
as the prince was about to thank her for her goodness, she added quickly,
&quot;However great may be my curiosity to learn by what means you have
travelled here so speedily, I know that you must be faint for want of food, so
I shall give orders to my women to take you to one of my chambers, where you
will be provided with supper, and left to repose.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By this time the princess's attendants were all
awake, and listening to the conversation. At a sign from their mistress they
rose, dressed themselves hastily, and snatching up some of the tapers which
lighted the room, conducted the prince to a large and lofty room, where two of
the number prepared his bed, and the rest went down to the kitchen, from which
they soon returned with all sorts of dishes. Then, showing him cupboards filled
with dresses and linen, they quitted the room. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>During their absence the Princess of Bengal, who
had been greatly struck by the beauty of the prince, tried in vain to go to
sleep again. It was of no use: she felt broad awake, and when her women entered
the room, she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted, and what they
thought of him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madame,&quot; they replied, &quot;it is of
course impossible for us to tell what impression this young man has made on
you. For ourselves, we think you would be fortunate if the king your father
should allow you to marry anyone so amiable. Certainly there is no one in the
Court of Bengal who can be compared with him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These flattering observations were by no means
displeasing to the princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings
she merely said, &quot;You are all a set of chatterboxes; go back to bed, and
let me sleep.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When she dressed the following morning, her
maids noticed that, contrary to her usual habit, the princess was very
particular about her toilette, and insisted on her hair being dressed two or
three times over. &quot;For,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;if my appearance
was not displeasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was, how
much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all my
charms.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then she placed in her hair the largest and most
brilliant diamonds she could find, with a necklace, bracelets and girdle, all
of precious stones. And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of the richest
stuff in all the Indies, that no one was allowed to wear except members of the
royal family. When she was fully dressed according to her wishes, she sent to
know if the Prince of Persia was awake and ready to receive her, as she desired
to present herself before him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the princess's messenger entered his room,
Prince Firouz Schah was in the act of leaving it, to inquire if he might be
allowed to pay his homage to her mistress: but on hearing the princess's
wishes, he at once gave way. &quot;Her will is my law,&quot; he said, &quot;I
am only here to obey her orders.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In a few moments the princess herself appeared,
and after the usual compliments had passed between them, the princess sat down
on a sofa, and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving him an
audience in her own apartments. &quot;Had I done so,&quot; she said, &quot;we
might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the eunuchs, who has
the right to enter whenever it pleases him, whereas this is forbidden ground. I
am all impatience to learn the wonderful accident which has procured the
pleasure of your arrival, and that is why I have come to you here, where no one
can intrude upon us. Begin then, I entreat you, without delay.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the prince began at the beginning, and told
all the story of the festival of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia, and of the
splendid spectacles celebrated in its honour. But when he came to the enchanted
horse, the princess declared that she could never have imagined anything half
so surprising. &quot;Well then,&quot; continued the prince, &quot;you can
easily understand how the King my father, who has a passion for all curious
things, was seized with a violent desire to possess this horse, and asked the
Indian what sum he would take for it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The man's answer was absolutely absurd, as
you will agree, when I tell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the
princess my sister; but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked, and I was
beside myself with rage, I saw to my despair that my father could not make up
his mind to treat the insolent proposal as it deserved. I tried to argue with
him, but in vain. He only begged me to examine the horse with a view (as I
quite understood) of making me more sensible of its value.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To please my father, I mounted the horse,
and, without waiting for any instructions from the Indian, turned the peg as I
had seen him do. In an instant I was soaring upwards, much quicker than an
arrow could fly, and I felt as if I must be getting so near the sky that I
should soon hit my head against it! I could see nothing beneath me, and for
some time was so confused that I did not even know in what direction I was
travelling. At last, when it was growing dark, I found another screw, and on
turning it, the horse began slowly to sink towards the earth. I was forced to
trust to chance, and to see what fate had in store, and it was already past
midnight when I found myself on the roof of this palace. I crept down the
little staircase, and made directly for a light which I perceived through an
open door--I peeped cautiously in, and saw, as you will guess, the eunuchs
lying asleep on the floor. I knew the risks I ran, but my need was so great
that I paid no attention to them, and stole safely past your guards, to the
curtain which concealed your doorway. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The rest, Princess, you know; and it only
remains for me to thank you for the kindness you have shown me, and to assure
you of my gratitude. By the law of nations, I am already your slave, and I have
only my heart, that is my own, to offer you. But what am I saying? My own?
Alas, madame, it was yours from the first moment I beheld you!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The air with which he said these words could
have left no doubt on the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms,
and the blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prince,&quot; returned she as soon as her
confusion permitted her to speak, &quot;you have given me the greatest
pleasure, and I have followed you closely in all your adventures, and though
you are positively sitting before me, I even trembled at your danger in the
upper regions of the air! Let me say what a debt I owe to the chance that has
led you to my house; you could have entered none which would have given you a
warmer welcome. As to your being a slave, of course that is merely a joke, and
my reception must itself have assured you that you are as free here as at your
father's court. As to your heart,&quot; continued she in tones of
encouragement, &quot;I am quite sure that must have been disposed of long ago,
to some princess who is well worthy of it, and I could not think of being the
cause of your unfaithfulness to her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Firouz Schah was about to protest that
there was no lady with any prior claims, but he was stopped by the entrance of
one of the princess's attendants, who announced that dinner was served, and,
after all, neither was sorry for the interruption. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment, and
the table was covered with delicious fruits; while during the repast richly
dressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments. After the prince
and princess had finished, they passed into a small room hung with blue and
gold, looking out into a garden stocked with flowers and arbutus trees, quite
different from any that were to be found in Persia. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Princess,&quot; observed the young man,
&quot;till now I had always believed that Persia could boast finer palaces and
more lovely gardens than any kingdom upon earth. But my eyes have been opened,
and I begin to perceive that, wherever there is a great king he will surround
himself with buildings worthy of him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prince,&quot; replied the Princess of
Bengal, &quot;I have no idea what a Persian palace is like, so I am unable to
make comparisons. I do not wish to depreciate my own palace, but I can assure
you that it is very poor beside that of the King my father, as you will agree
when you have been there to greet him, as I hope you will shortly do.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the princess hoped that, by bringing about a
meeting between the prince and her father, the King would be so struck with the
young man's distinguished air and fine manners, that he would offer him his
daughter to wife. But the reply of the Prince of Persia to her suggestion was
not quite what she wished. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madame,&quot; he said, &quot;by taking
advantage of your proposal to visit the palace of the King of Bengal, I should
satisfy not merely my curiosity, but also the sentiments of respect with which
I regard him. But, Princess, I am persuaded that you will feel with me, that I
cannot possibly present myself before so great a sovereign without the
attendants suitable to my rank. He would think me an adventurer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If that is all,&quot; she answered,
&quot;you can get as many attendants here as you please. There are plenty of
Persian merchants, and as for money, my treasury is always open to you. Take
what you please.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Firouz Schah guessed what prompted so
much kindness on the part of the princess, and was much touched by it. Still
his passion, which increased every moment, did not make him forget his duty. So
he replied without hesitation: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I do not know, Princess, how to express my
gratitude for your obliging offer, which I would accept at once if it were not
for the recollection of all the uneasiness the King my father must be suffering
on my account. I should be unworthy indeed of all the love he showers upon me,
if I did not return to him at the first possible moment. For, while I am
enjoying the society of the most amiable of all princesses, he is, I am quite
convinced, plunged in the deepest grief, having lost all hope of seeing me
again. I am sure you will understand my position, and will feel that to remain
away one instant longer than is necessary would not only be ungrateful on my
part, but perhaps even a crime, for how do I know if my absence may not break
his heart? </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But,&quot; continued the prince,
&quot;having obeyed the voice of my conscience, I shall count the moments when,
with your gracious permission, I may present myself before the King of Bengal,
not as a wanderer, but as a prince, to implore the favour of your hand. My
father has always informed me that in my marriage I shall be left quite free,
but I am persuaded that I have only to describe your generosity, for my wishes
to become his own.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not to
accept the explanation offered by Prince Firouz Schah, but she was much
disturbed at his intention of departing at once, for she feared that, no sooner
had he left her, than the impression she had made on him would fade away. So
she made one more effort to keep him, and after assuring him that she entirely
approved of his anxiety to see his father, begged him to give her a day or two
more of his company. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In common politeness the prince could hardly
refuse this request, and the princess set about inventing every kind of
amusement for him, and succeeded so well that two months slipped by almost
unnoticed, in balls, spectacles and in hunting, of which, when unattended by
danger, the princess was passionately fond. But at last, one day, he declared
seriously that he could neglect his duty no longer, and entreated her to put no
further obstacles in his way, promising at the same time to return, as soon as
he could, with all the magnificence due both to her and to himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Princess,&quot; he added, &quot;it may be
that in your heart you class me with those false lovers whose devotion cannot
stand the test of absence. If you do, you wrong me; and were it not for fear of
offending you, I would beseech you to come with me, for my life can only be
happy when passed with you. As for your reception at the Persian Court, it will
be as warm as your merits deserve; and as for what concerns the King of Bengal,
he must be much more indifferent to your welfare than you have led me to
believe if he does not give his consent to our marriage.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess could not find words in which to
reply to the arguments of the Prince of Persia, but her silence and her
downcast eyes spoke for her, and declared that she had no objection to
accompanying him on his travels. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The only difficulty that occurred to her was
that Prince Firouz Schah did not know how to manage the horse, and she dreaded
lest they might find themselves in the same plight as before. But the prince
soothed her fears so successfully, that she soon had no other thought than to
arrange for their flight so secretly, that no one in the palace should suspect
it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This was done, and early the following morning,
when the whole palace was wrapped in sleep, she stole up on to the roof, where
the prince was already awaiting her, with his horse's head towards Persia. He
mounted first and helped the princess up behind; then, when she was firmly
seated, with her hands holding tightly to his belt, he touched the screw, and
the horse began to leave the earth quickly behind him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He travelled with his accustomed speed, and
Prince Firouz Schah guided him so well that in two hours and a half from the
time of starting, he saw the capital of Persia lying beneath him. He determined
to alight neither in the great square from which he had started, nor in the
Sultan's palace, but in a country house at a little distance from the town.
Here he showed the princess a beautiful suite of rooms, and begged her to rest,
while he informed his father of their arrival, and prepared a public reception
worthy of her rank. Then he ordered a horse to be saddled, and set out. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All the way through the streets he was welcomed
with shouts of joy by the people, who had long lost all hope of seeing him
again. On reaching the palace, he found the Sultan surrounded by his ministers,
all clad in the deepest mourning, and his father almost went out of his mind
with surprise and delight at the mere sound of his son's voice. When he had
calmed down a little, he begged the prince to relate his adventures. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince at once seized the opening thus given
him, and told the whole story of his treatment by the Princess of Bengal, not
even concealing the fact that she had fallen in love with him. &quot;And,
Sire,&quot; ended the prince, &quot;having given my royal word that you would
not refuse your consent to our marriage, I persuaded her to return with me on
the Indian's horse. I have left her in one of your Highness's country houses,
where she is waiting anxiously to be assured that I have not promised in
vain.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As he said this the prince was about to throw
himself at the feet of the Sultan, but his father prevented him, and embracing
him again, said eagerly: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son, not only do I gladly consent to
your marriage with the Princess of Bengal, but I will hasten to pay my respects
to her, and to thank her in my own person for the benefits she has conferred on
you. I will then bring her back with me, and make all arrangements for the
wedding to be celebrated to-day.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the Sultan gave orders that the habits of
mourning worn by the people should be thrown off and that there should be a
concert of drums, trumpets and cymbals. Also that the Indian should be taken
from prison, and brought before him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His commands were obeyed, and the Indian was led
into his presence, surrounded by guards. &quot;I have kept you locked up,&quot;
said the Sultan, &quot;so that in case my son was lost, your life should pay
the penalty. He has now returned; so take your horse, and begone for
ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Indian hastily quitted the presence of the
Sultan, and when he was outside, he inquired of the man who had taken him out
of prison where the prince had really been all this time, and what he had been
doing. They told him the whole story, and how the Princess of Bengal was even
then awaiting in the country palace the consent of the Sultan, which at once
put into the Indian's head a plan of revenge for the treatment he had
experienced. Going straight to the country house, he informed the doorkeeper
who was left in charge that he had been sent by the Sultan and by the Prince of
Persia to fetch the princess on the enchanted horse, and to bring her to the
palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The doorkeeper knew the Indian by sight, and was
of course aware that nearly three months before he had been thrown into prison
by the Sultan; and seeing him at liberty, the man took for granted that he was
speaking the truth, and made no difficulty about leading him before the
Princess of Bengal; while on her side, hearing that he had come from the prince,
the lady gladly consented to do what he wished. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Indian, delighted with the success of his
scheme, mounted the horse, assisted the princess to mount behind him, and
turned the peg at the very moment that the prince was leaving the palace in
Schiraz for the country house, followed closely by the Sultan and all the
court. Knowing this, the Indian deliberately steered the horse right above the
city, in order that his revenge for his unjust imprisonment might be all the
quicker and sweeter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Sultan of Persia saw the horse and its
riders, he stopped short with astonishment and horror, and broke out into oaths
and curses, which the Indian heard quite unmoved, knowing that he was perfectly
safe from pursuit. But mortified and furious as the Sultan was, his feelings
were nothing to those of Prince Firouz Schah, when he saw the object of his
passionate devotion being borne rapidly away. And while he was struck
speechless with grief and remorse at not having guarded her better, she
vanished swiftly out of his sight. What was he to do? Should he follow his
father into the palace, and there give reins to his despair? Both his love and
his courage alike forbade it; and he continued his way to the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sight of the prince showed the doorkeeper of
what folly he had been guilty, and flinging himself at his master's feet,
implored his pardon. &quot;Rise,&quot; said the prince, &quot;I am the cause of
this misfortune, and not you. Go and find me the dress of a dervish, but beware
of saying it is for me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At a short distance from the country house, a
convent of dervishes was situated, and the superior, or scheih, was the
doorkeeper's friend. So by means of a false story made up on the spur of the
moment, it was easy enough to get hold of a dervish's dress, which the prince
at once put on, instead of his own. Disguised like this and concealing about
him a box of pearls and diamonds he had intended as a present to the princess,
he left the house at nightfall, uncertain where he should go, but firmly
resolved not to return without her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meanwhile the Indian had turned the horse in
such a direction that, before many hours had passed, it had entered a wood
close to the capital of the kingdom of Cashmere. Feeling very hungry, and
supposing that the princess also might be in want of food, he brought his steed
down to the earth, and left the princess in a shady place, on the banks of a
clear stream. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At first, when the princess had found herself
alone, the idea had occurred to her of trying to escape and hide herself. But
as she had eaten scarcely anything since she had left Bengal, she felt she was
too weak to venture far, and was obliged to abandon her design. On the return
of the Indian with meats of various kinds, she began to eat voraciously, and soon
had regained sufficient courage to reply with spirit to his insolent remarks.
Goaded by his threats she sprang to her feet, calling loudly for help, and
luckily her cries were heard by a troop of horsemen, who rode up to inquire
what was the matter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the leader of these horsemen was the Sultan
of Cashmere, returning from the chase, and he instantly turned to the Indian to
inquire who he was, and whom he had with him. The Indian rudely answered that
it was his wife, and there was no occasion for anyone else to interfere between
them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess, who, of course, was ignorant of
the rank of her deliverer, denied altogether the Indian's story. &quot;My
lord,&quot; she cried, &quot;whoever you may be, put no faith in this impostor.
He is an abominable magician, who has this day torn me from the Prince of
Persia, my destined husband, and has brought me here on this enchanted
horse.&quot; She would have continued, but her tears choked her, and the Sultan
of Cashmere, convinced by her beauty and her distinguished air of the truth of
her tale, ordered his followers to cut off the Indian's head, which was done
immediately. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But rescued though she was from one peril, it
seemed as if she had only fallen into another. The Sultan commanded a horse to
be given her, and conducted her to his own palace, where he led her to a
beautiful apartment, and selected female slaves to wait on her, and eunuchs to
be her guard. Then, without allowing her time to thank him for all he had done,
he bade her repose, saying she should tell him her adventures on the following
day. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess fell asleep, flattering herself
that she had only to relate her story for the Sultan to be touched by
compassion, and to restore her to the prince without delay. But a few hours
were to undeceive her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the King of Cashmere had quitted her
presence the evening before, he had resolved that the sun should not set again
without the princess becoming his wife, and at daybreak proclamation of his
intention was made throughout the town, by the sound of drums, trumpets, cymbals,
and other instruments calculated to fill the heart with joy. The Princess of
Bengal was early awakened by the noise, but she did not for one moment imagine
that it had anything to do with her, till the Sultan, arriving as soon as she
was dressed to inquire after her health, informed her that the trumpet blasts
she heard were part of the solemn marriage ceremonies, for which he begged her
to prepare. This unexpected announcement caused the princess such terror that
she sank down in a dead faint. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid,
and the Sultan himself did his best to bring her back to consciousness, but for
a long while it was all to no purpose. At length her senses began slowly to
come back to her, and then, rather than break faith with the Prince of Persia
by consenting to such a marriage, she determined to feign madness. So she began
by saying all sorts of absurdities, and using all kinds of strange gestures,
while the Sultan stood watching her with sorrow and surprise. But as this sudden
seizure showed no sign of abating, he left her to her women, ordering them to
take the greatest care of her. Still, as the day went on, the malady seemed to
become worse, and by night it was almost violent. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Days passed in this manner, till at last the
Sultan of Cashmere decided to summon all the doctors of his court to consult
together over her sad state. Their answer was that madness is of so many
different kinds that it was impossible to give an opinion on the case without
seeing the princess, so the Sultan gave orders that they were to be introduced
into her chamber, one by one, every man according to his rank. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This decision had been foreseen by the princess,
who knew quite well that if once she allowed the physicians to feel her pulse,
the most ignorant of them would discover that she was in perfectly good health,
and that her madness was feigned, so as each man approached, she broke out into
such violent paroxysms, that not one dared to lay a finger on her. A few, who
pretended to be cleverer than the rest, declared that they could diagnose sick
people only from sight, ordered her certain potions, which she made no
difficulty about taking, as she was persuaded they were all harmless. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Sultan of Cashmere saw that the court
doctors could do nothing towards curing the princess, he called in those of the
city, who fared no better. Then he had recourse to the most celebrated
physicians in the other large towns, but finding that the task was beyond their
science, he finally sent messengers into the other neighbouring states, with a
memorandum containing full particulars of the princess's madness, offering at
the same time to pay the expenses of any physician who would come and see for
himself, and a handsome reward to the one who should cure her. In answer to
this proclamation many foreign professors flocked into Cashmere, but they
naturally were not more successful than the rest had been, as the cure depended
neither on them nor their skill, but only on the princess herself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was during this time that Prince Firouz
Schah, wandering sadly and hopelessly from place to place, arrived in a large
city of India, where he heard a great deal of talk about the Princess of Bengal
who had gone out of her senses, on the very day that she was to have been married
to the Sultan of Cashmere. This was quite enough to induce him to take the road
to Cashmere, and to inquire at the first inn at which he lodged in the capital
the full particulars of the story. When he knew that he had at last found the
princess whom he had so long lost, he set about devising a plan for her rescue.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The first thing he did was to procure a doctor's
robe, so that his dress, added to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his
travels, might unmistakably proclaim his profession. He then lost no time in
going to the palace, where he obtained an audience of the chief usher, and
while apologising for his boldness in presuming to think that he could cure the
princess, where so many others had failed, declared that he had the secret of certain
remedies, which had hitherto never failed of their effect. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The chief usher assured him that he was heartily
welcome, and that the Sultan would receive him with pleasure; and in case of
success, he would gain a magnificent reward. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Prince of Persia, in the disguise of a
physician, was brought before him, the Sultan wasted no time in talking, beyond
remarking that the mere sight of a doctor threw the princess into transports of
rage. He then led the prince up to a room under the roof, which had an opening
through which he might observe the princess, without himself being seen. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince looked, and beheld the princess
reclining on a sofa with tears in her eyes, singing softly to herself a song
bewailing her sad destiny, which had deprived her, perhaps for ever, of a being
she so tenderly loved. The young man's heart beat fast as he listened, for he
needed no further proof that her madness was feigned, and that it was love of
him which had caused her to resort to this species of trick. He softly left his
hiding-place, and returned to the Sultan, to whom he reported that he was sure
from certain signs that the princess's malady was not incurable, but that he
must see her and speak with her alone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan made no difficulty in consenting to
this, and commanded that he should be ushered in to the princess's apartment.
The moment she caught sight of his physician's robe, she sprang from her seat
in a fury, and heaped insults upon him. The prince took no notice of her
behaviour, and approaching quite close, so that his words might be heard by her
alone, he said in a low whisper, &quot;Look at me, princess, and you will see
that I am no doctor, but the Prince of Persia, who has come to set you
free.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the sound of his voice, the Princess of
Bengal suddenly grew calm, and an expression of joy overspread her face, such
as only comes when what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly happens
to us. For some time she was too enchanted to speak, and Prince Firouz Schah
took advantage of her silence to explain to her all that had occurred, his
despair at watching her disappear before his very eyes, the oath he had sworn
to follow her over the world, and his rapture at finally discovering her in the
palace at Cashmere. When he had finished, he begged in his turn that the
princess would tell him how she had come there, so that he might the better
devise some means of rescuing her from the tyranny of the Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It needed but a few words from the princess to
make him acquainted with the whole situation, and how she had been forced to
play the part of a mad woman in order to escape from a marriage with the
Sultan, who had not had sufficient politeness even to ask her consent. If
necessary, she added, she had resolved to die sooner than permit herself to be
forced into such a union, and break faith with a prince whom she loved. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince then inquired if she knew what had
become of the enchanted horse since the Indian's death, but the princess could
only reply that she had heard nothing about it. Still she did not suppose that
the horse could have been forgotten by the Sultan, after all she had told him
of its value. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>To this the prince agreed, and they consulted
together over a plan by which she might be able to make her escape and return
with him into Persia. And as the first step, she was to dress herself with
care, and receive the Sultan with civility when he visited her next morning. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was transported with delight on
learning the result of the interview, and his opinion of the doctor's skill was
raised still higher when, on the following day, the princess behaved towards
him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete cure would not be long
delayed. However he contented himself with assuring her how happy he was to see
her health so much improved, and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a
physician, and to repose entire confidence in him. Then he retired, without
awaiting any reply from the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Prince of Persia left the room at the same
time, and asked if he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the
Princess of Bengal had reached Cashmere, which was so far distant from her
father's kingdom, and how she came to be there alone. The Sultan thought the
question very natural, and told him the same story that the Princess of Bengal
had done, adding that he had ordered the enchanted horse to be taken to his
treasury as a curiosity, though he was quite ignorant how it could be used. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the physician,
&quot;your Highness's tale has supplied me with the clue I needed to complete
the recovery of the princess. During her voyage hither on an enchanted horse, a
portion of its enchantment has by some means been communicated to her person,
and it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which I possess the
secret. If your Highness will deign to consent, and to give the court and the
people one of the most astonishing spectacles they have ever witnessed, command
the horse to be brought into the big square outside the palace, and leave the
rest to me. I promise that in a very few moments, in presence of all the
assembled multitude, you shall see the princess as healthy both in mind and
body as ever she was in her life. And in order to make the spectacle as
impressive as possible, I would suggest that she should be richly dressed and
covered with the noblest jewels of the crown.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan readily agreed to all that the prince
proposed, and the following morning he desired that the enchanted horse should
be taken from the treasury, and brought into the great square of the palace.
Soon the rumour began to spread through the town, that something extraordinary
was about to happen, and such a crowd began to collect that the guards had to
be called out to keep order, and to make a way for the enchanted horse. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When all was ready, the Sultan appeared, and
took his place on a platform, surrounded by the chief nobles and officers of
his court. When they were seated, the Princess of Bengal was seen leaving the
palace, accompanied by the ladies who had been assigned to her by the Sultan.
She slowly approached the enchanted horse, and with the help of her ladies, she
mounted on its back. Directly she was in the saddle, with her feet in the
stirrups and the bridle in her hand, the physician placed around the horse some
large braziers full of burning coals, into each of which he threw a perfume
composed of all sorts of delicious scents. Then he crossed his hands over his
breast, and with lowered eyes walked three times round the horse, muttering the
while certain words. Soon there arose from the burning braziers a thick smoke
which almost concealed both the horse and princess, and this was the moment for
which he had been waiting. Springing lightly up behind the lady, he leaned
forward and turned the peg, and as the horse darted up into the air, he cried
aloud so that his words were heard by all present, &quot;Sultan of Cashmere,
when you wish to marry princesses who have sought your protection, learn first
to gain their consent.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was in this way that the Prince of Persia
rescued the Princess of Bengal, and returned with her to Persia, where they
descended this time before the palace of the King himself. The marriage was
only delayed just long enough to make the ceremony as brilliant as possible,
and, as soon as the rejoicings were over, an ambassador was sent to the King of
Bengal, to inform him of what had passed, and to ask his approbation of the
alliance between the two countries, which he heartily gave. </span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%'>The Story of Two Sisters Who Were
Jealous of Their Younger Sister</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time there reigned over Persia a
Sultan named Kosrouschah, who from his boyhood had been fond of putting on a
disguise and seeking adventures in all parts of the city, accompanied by one of
his officers, disguised like himself. And no sooner was his father buried and
the ceremonies over that marked his accession to the throne, than the young man
hastened to throw off his robes of state, and calling to his vizir to make
ready likewise, stole out in the simple dress of a private citizen into the
less known streets of the capital. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Passing down a lonely street, the Sultan heard
women's voices in loud discussion; and peeping through a crack in the door, he
saw three sisters, sitting on a sofa in a large hall, talking in a very lively
and earnest manner. Judging from the few words that reached his ear, they were
each explaining what sort of men they wished to marry. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I ask nothing better,&quot; cried the
eldest, &quot;than to have the Sultan's baker for a husband. Think of being
able to eat as much as one wanted, of that delicious bread that is baked for
his Highness alone! Let us see if your wish is as good as mine.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I,&quot; replied the second sister,
&quot;should be quite content with the Sultan's head cook. What delicate stews
I should feast upon! And, as I am persuaded that the Sultan's bread is used all
through the palace, I should have that into the bargain. You see, my dear
sister, my taste is as good as yours.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was now the turn of the youngest sister, who
was by far the most beautiful of the three, and had, besides, more sense than
the other two. &quot;As for me,&quot; she said, &quot;I should take a higher
flight; and if we are to wish for husbands, nothing less than the Sultan
himself will do for me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was so much amused by the conversation
he had overheard, that he made up his mind to gratify their wishes, and turning
to the grand-vizir, he bade him note the house, and on the following morning to
bring the ladies into his presence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir fulfilled his commission, and
hardly giving them time to change their dresses, desired the three sisters to
follow him to the palace. Here they were presented one by one, and when they
had bowed before the Sultan, the sovereign abruptly put the question to them: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell me, do you remember what you wished
for last night, when you were making merry? Fear nothing, but answer me the
truth.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These words, which were so unexpected, threw the
sisters into great confusion, their eyes fell, and the blushes of the youngest
did not fail to make an impression on the heart of the Sultan. All three
remained silent, and he hastened to continue: &quot;Do not be afraid, I have
not the slightest intention of giving you pain, and let me tell you at once,
that I know the wishes formed by each one. You,&quot; he said, turning to the
youngest, &quot;who desired to have me for an husband, shall be satisfied this
very day. And you,&quot; he added, addressing himself to the other two,
&quot;shall be married at the same moment to my baker and to my chief
cook.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Sultan had finished speaking the three
sisters flung themselves at his feet, and the youngest faltered out, &quot;Oh,
sire, since you know my foolish words, believe, I pray you, that they were only
said in joke. I am unworthy of the honour you propose to do me, and I can only ask
pardon for my boldness.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The other sisters also tried to excuse
themselves, but the Sultan would hear nothing. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, no,&quot; he said, &quot;my mind is
made up. Your wishes shall be accomplished.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the three weddings were celebrated that same
day, but with a great difference. That of the youngest was marked by all the
magnificence that was customary at the marriage of the Shah of Persia, while
the festivities attending the nuptials of the Sultan's baker and his chief cook
were only such as were suitable to their conditions. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This, though quite natural, was highly
displeasing to the elder sisters, who fell into a passion of jealousy, which in
the end caused a great deal of trouble and pain to several people. And the
first time that they had the opportunity of speaking to each other, which was
not till several days later at a public bath, they did not attempt to disguise
their feelings. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Can you possibly understand what the
Sultan saw in that little cat,&quot; said one to the other, &quot;for him to be
so fascinated by her?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He must be quite blind,&quot; returned the
wife of the chief cook. &quot;As for her looking a little younger than we do,
what does that matter? You would have made a far better Sultana than she.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, I say nothing of myself,&quot; replied
the elder, &quot;and if the Sultan had chosen you it would have been all very
well; but it really grieves me that he should have selected a wretched little
creature like that. However, I will be revenged on her somehow, and I beg you
will give me your help in the matter, and to tell me anything that you can
think of that is likely to mortify her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In order to carry out their wicked scheme the
two sisters met constantly to talk over their ideas, though all the while they
pretended to be as friendly as ever towards the Sultana, who, on her part,
invariably treated them with kindness. For a long time no plan occurred to the
two plotters that seemed in the least likely to meet with success, but at
length the expected birth of an heir gave them the chance for which they had
been hoping. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They obtained permission of the Sultan to take
up their abode in the palace for some weeks, and never left their sister night
or day. When at last a little boy, beautiful as the sun, was born, they laid
him in his cradle and carried it down to a canal which passed through the
grounds of the palace. Then, leaving it to its fate, they informed the Sultan
that instead of the son he had so fondly desired the Sultana had given birth to
a puppy. At this dreadful news the Sultan was so overcome with rage and grief
that it was with great difficulty that the grand-vizir managed to save the
Sultana from his wrath. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Meanwhile the cradle continued to float
peacefully along the canal till, on the outskirts of the royal gardens, it was
suddenly perceived by the intendant, one of the highest and most respected
officials in the kingdom. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go,&quot; he said to a gardener who was
working near, &quot;and get that cradle out for me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener did as he was bid, and soon placed
the cradle in the hands of the intendant. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The official was much astonished to see that the
cradle, which he had supposed to be empty, contained a baby, which, young
though it was, already gave promise of great beauty. Having no children
himself, although he had been married some years, it at once occurred to him
that here was a child which he could take and bring up as his own. And, bidding
the man pick up the cradle and follow him, he turned towards home. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My wife,&quot; he exclaimed as he entered
the room, &quot;heaven has denied us any children, but here is one that has
been sent in their place. Send for a nurse, and I will do what is needful
publicly to recognise it as my son.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The wife accepted the baby with joy, and though
the intendant saw quite well that it must have come from the royal palace, he
did not think it was his business to inquire further into the mystery. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The following year another prince was born and
sent adrift, but happily for the baby, the intendant of the gardens again was
walking by the canal, and carried it home as before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan, naturally enough, was still more
furious the second time than the first, but when the same curious accident was
repeated in the third year he could control himself no longer, and, to the
great joy of the jealous sisters, commanded that the Sultana should be
executed. But the poor lady was so much beloved at Court that not even the
dread of sharing her fate could prevent the grand-vizir and the courtiers from
throwing themselves at the Sultan's feet and imploring him not to inflict so
cruel a punishment for what, after all, was not her fault. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let her live,&quot; entreated the
grand-vizir, &quot;and banish her from your presence for the rest of her days.
That in itself will be punishment enough.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His first passion spent, the Sultan had regained
his self-command. &quot;Let her live then,&quot; he said, &quot;since you have
it so much at heart. But if I grant her life it shall only be on one condition,
which shall make her daily pray for death. Let a box be built for her at the
door of the principal mosque, and let the window of the box be always open.
There she shall sit, in the coarsest clothes, and every Mussulman who enters
the mosque shall spit in her face in passing. Anyone that refuses to obey shall
be exposed to the same punishment himself. You, vizir, will see that my orders
are carried out.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir saw that it was useless to say
more, and, full of triumph, the sisters watched the building of the box, and
then listened to the jeers of the people at the helpless Sultana sitting
inside. But the poor lady bore herself with so much dignity and meekness that
it was not long before she had won the sympathy of those that were best among
the crowd. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But it is now time to return to the fate of the
third baby, this time a princess. Like its brothers, it was found by the
intendant of the gardens, and adopted by him and his wife, and all three were
brought up with the greatest care and tenderness. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As the children grew older their beauty and air
of distinction became more and more marked, and their manners had all the grace
and ease that is proper to people of high birth. The princes had been named by
their foster-father Bahman and Perviz, after two of the ancient kings of
Persia, while the princess was called Parizade, or the child of the genii. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The intendant was careful to bring them up as
befitted their real rank, and soon appointed a tutor to teach the young princes
how to read and write. And the princess, determined not to be left behind,
showed herself so anxious to learn with her brothers, that the intendant
consented to her joining in their lessons, and it was not long before she knew
as much as they did. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From that time all their studies were done in
common. They had the best masters for the fine arts, geography, poetry, history
and science, and even for sciences which are learned by few, and every branch
seemed so easy to them, that their teachers were astonished at the progress
they made. The princess had a passion for music, and could sing and play upon
all sorts of instruments she could also ride and drive as well as her brothers,
shoot with a bow and arrow, and throw a javelin with the same skill as they,
and sometimes even better. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In order to set off these accomplishments, the
intendant resolved that his foster children should not be pent up any longer in
the narrow borders of the palace gardens, where he had always lived, so he
bought a splendid country house a few miles from the capital, surrounded by an
immense park. This park he filled with wild beasts of various sorts, so that
the princes and princess might hunt as much as they pleased. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When everything was ready, the intendant threw
himself at the Sultan's feet, and after referring to his age and his long
services, begged his Highness's permission to resign his post. This was granted
by the Sultan in a few gracious words, and he then inquired what reward he
could give to his faithful servant. But the intendant declared that he wished
for nothing except the continuance of his Highness's favour, and prostrating
himself once more, he retired from the Sultan's presence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Five or six months passed away in the pleasures
of the country, when death attacked the intendant so suddenly that he had no
time to reveal the secret of their birth to his adopted children, and as his
wife had long been dead also, it seemed as if the princes and the princess
would never know that they had been born to a higher station than the one they
filled. Their sorrow for their father was very deep, and they lived quietly on
in their new home, without feeling any desire to leave it for court gaieties or
intrigues. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day the princes as usual went out to hunt,
but their sister remained alone in her apartments. While they were gone an old
Mussulman devotee appeared at the door, and asked leave to enter, as it was the
hour of prayer. The princess sent orders at once that the old woman was to be
taken to the private oratory in the grounds, and when she had finished her
prayers was to be shown the house and gardens, and then to be brought before
her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Although the old woman was very pious, she was
not at all indifferent to the magnificence of all around her, which she seemed
to understand as well as to admire, and when she had seen it all she was led by
the servants before the princess, who was seated in a room which surpassed in
splendour all the rest. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My good woman,&quot; said the princess
pointing to a sofa, &quot;come and sit beside me. I am delighted at the
opportunity of speaking for a few moments with so holy a person.&quot; The old
woman made some objections to so much honour being done her, but the princess
refused to listen, and insisted that her guest should take the best seat, and
as she thought she must be tired ordered refreshments. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While the old woman was eating, the princess put
several questions to her as to her mode of life, and the pious exercises she
practiced, and then inquired what she thought of the house now that she had
seen it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the pilgrim,
&quot;one must be hard indeed to please to find any fault. It is beautiful,
comfortable and well ordered, and it is impossible to imagine anything more
lovely than the garden. But since you ask me, I must confess that it lacks
three things to make it absolutely perfect.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And what can they be?&quot; cried the
princess. &quot;Only tell me, and I will lose no time in getting them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The three things, madam,&quot; replied the
old woman, &quot;are, first, the Talking Bird, whose voice draws all other
singing birds to it, to join in chorus. And second, the Singing Tree, where
every leaf is a song that is never silent. And lastly the Golden Water, of which
it is only needful to pour a single drop into a basin for it to shoot up into a
fountain, which will never be exhausted, nor will the basin ever
overflow.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, how can I thank you,&quot; cried the
princess, &quot;for telling me of such treasures! But add, I pray you, to your
goodness by further informing me where I can find them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the pilgrim, &quot;I
should ill repay the hospitality you have shown me if I refused to answer your
question. The three things of which I have spoken are all to be found in one
place, on the borders of this kingdom, towards India. Your messenger has only
to follow the road that passes by your house, for twenty days, and at the end
of that time, he is to ask the first person he meets for the Talking Bird, the
Singing Tree, and the Golden Water.&quot; She then rose, and bidding farewell
to the princess, went her way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old woman had taken her departure so
abruptly that the Princess Parizade did not perceive till she was really gone
that the directions were hardly clear enough to enable the search to be
successful. And she was still thinking of the subject, and how delightful it
would be to possess such rarities, when the princes, her brothers, returned
from the chase. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What is the matter, my sister?&quot; asked
Prince Bahman; &quot;why are you so grave? Are you ill? Or has anything
happened?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Princess Parizade did not answer directly, but
at length she raised her eyes, and replied that there was nothing wrong. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But there must be something,&quot;
persisted Prince Bahman, &quot;for you to have changed so much during the short
time we have been absent. Hide nothing from us, I beseech you, unless you wish
us to believe that the confidence we have always had in one another is now to
cease.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;When I said that it was nothing,&quot;
said the princess, moved by his words, &quot;I meant that it was nothing that
affected you, although I admit that it is certainly of some importance to me.
Like myself, you have always thought this house that our father built for us
was perfect in every respect, but only to-day I have learned that three things
are still lacking to complete it. These are the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree,
and the Golden Water.&quot; After explaining the peculiar qualities of each,
the princess continued: &quot;It was a Mussulman devotee who told me all this,
and where they might all be found. Perhaps you will think that the house is
beautiful enough as it is, and that we can do quite well without them; but in
this I cannot agree with you, and I shall never be content until I have got
them. So counsel me, I pray, whom to send on the undertaking.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My dear sister,&quot; replied Prince
Bahman, &quot;that you should care about the matter is quite enough, even if we
took no interest in it ourselves. But we both feel with you, and I claim, as
the elder, the right to make the first attempt, if you will tell me where I am
to go, and what steps I am to take.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Perviz at first objected that, being the
head of the family, his brother ought not to be allowed to expose himself to
danger; but Prince Bahman would hear nothing, and retired to make the needful
preparations for his journey. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning Prince Bahman got up very
early, and after bidding farewell to his brother and sister, mounted his horse.
But just as he was about to touch it with his whip, he was stopped by a cry
from the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, perhaps after all you may never come
back; one never can tell what accidents may happen. Give it up, I implore you,
for I would a thousand times rather lose the Talking Bird, and the Singing Tree
and the Golden Water, than that you should run into danger.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My dear sister,&quot; answered the prince,
&quot;accidents only happen to unlucky people, and I hope that I am not one of
them. But as everything is uncertain, I promise you to be very careful. Take
this knife,&quot; he continued, handing her one that hung sheathed from his
belt, &quot;and every now and then draw it out and look at it. As long as it
keeps bright and clean as it is to-day, you will know that I am living; but if
the blade is spotted with blood, it will be a sign that I am dead, and you
shall weep for me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying, Prince Bahman bade them farewell once
more, and started on the high road, well mounted and fully armed. For twenty
days he rode straight on, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left,
till he found himself drawing near the frontiers of Persia. Seated under a tree
by the wayside he noticed a hideous old man, with a long white moustache, and
beard that almost fell to his feet. His nails had grown to an enormous length,
and on his head he wore a huge hat, which served him for an umbrella. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Bahman, who, remembering the directions
of the old woman, had been since sunrise on the look-out for some one,
recognised the old man at once to be a dervish. He dismounted from his horse,
and bowed low before the holy man, saying by way of greeting, &quot;My father,
may your days be long in the land, and may all your wishes be fulfilled!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The dervish did his best to reply, but his
moustache was so thick that his words were hardly intelligible, and the prince,
perceiving what was the matter, took a pair of scissors from his saddle
pockets, and requested permission to cut off some of the moustache, as he had a
question of great importance to ask the dervish. The dervish made a sign that
he might do as he liked, and when a few inches of his hair and beard had been
pruned all round the prince assured the holy man that he would hardly believe
how much younger he looked. The dervish smiled at his compliments, and thanked
him for what he had done. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let me,&quot; he said, &quot;show you my
gratitude for making me more comfortable by telling me what I can do for
you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Gentle dervish,&quot; replied Prince
Bahman, &quot;I come from far, and I seek the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree,
and the Golden Water. I know that they are to be found somewhere in these
parts, but I am ignorant of the exact spot. Tell me, I pray you, if you can, so
that I may not have travelled on a useless quest.&quot; While he was speaking,
the prince observed a change in the countenance of the dervish, who waited for
some time before he made reply. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I do
know the road for which you ask, but your kindness and the friendship I have
conceived for you make me loth to point it out.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But why not?&quot; inquired the prince.
&quot;What danger can there be?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The very greatest danger,&quot; answered
the dervish. &quot;Other men, as brave as you, have ridden down this road, and
have put me that question. I did my best to turn them also from their purpose,
but it was of no use. Not one of them would listen to my words, and not one of
them came back. Be warned in time, and seek to go no further.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am grateful to you for your interest in
me,&quot; said Prince Bahman, &quot;and for the advice you have given, though I
cannot follow it. But what dangers can there be in the adventure which courage
and a good sword cannot meet?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And suppose,&quot; answered the dervish,
&quot;that your enemies are invisible, how then?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Nothing will make me give it up,&quot;
replied the prince, &quot;and for the last time I ask you to tell me where I am
to go.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the dervish saw that the prince's mind was
made up, he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him, and held it out. &quot;If
it must be so,&quot; he said, with a sigh, &quot;take this, and when you have
mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you. It will roll on till it
reaches the foot of a mountain, and when it stops you will stop also. You will
then throw the bridle on your horse's neck without any fear of his straying,
and will dismount. On each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones,
and will hear a multitude of insulting voices, but pay no heed to them, and,
above all, beware of ever turning your head. If you do, you will instantly
become a black stone like the rest. For those stones are in reality men like
yourself, who have been on the same quest, and have failed, as I fear that you
may fail also. If you manage to avoid this pitfall, and to reach the top of the
mountain, you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage, and you can
ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water. That is
all I have to say. You know what you have to do, and what to avoid, but if you
are wise you will think of it no more, but return whence you have come.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince smilingly shook his head, and
thanking the dervish once more, he sprang on his horse and threw the ball
before him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The ball rolled along the road so fast that
Prince Bahman had much difficulty in keeping up with it, and it never relaxed
its speed till the foot of the mountain was reached. Then it came to a sudden
halt, and the prince at once got down and flung the bridle on his horse's neck.
He paused for a moment and looked round him at the masses of black stones with
which the sides of the mountain were covered, and then began resolutely to
ascend. He had hardly gone four steps when he heard the sound of voices around
him, although not another creature was in sight. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who is this imbecile?&quot; cried some,
&quot;stop him at once.&quot; &quot;Kill him,&quot; shrieked others,
&quot;Help! robbers! murderers! help! help!&quot; &quot;Oh, let him
alone,&quot; sneered another, and this was the most trying of all, &quot;he is
such a beautiful young man; I am sure the bird and the cage must have been kept
for him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At first the prince took no heed to all this
clamour, but continued to press forward on his way. Unfortunately this conduct,
instead of silencing the voices, only seemed to irritate them the more, and
they arose with redoubled fury, in front as well as behind. After some time he
grew bewildered, his knees began to tremble, and finding himself in the act of
falling, he forgot altogether the advice of the dervish. He turned to fly down
the mountain, and in one moment became a black stone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As may be imagined, Prince Perviz and his sister
were all this time in the greatest anxiety, and consulted the magic knife, not
once but many times a day. Hitherto the blade had remained bright and spotless,
but on the fatal hour on which Prince Bahman and his horse were changed into
black stones, large drops of blood appeared on the surface. &quot;Ah! my
beloved brother,&quot; cried the princess in horror, throwing the knife from
her, &quot;I shall never see you again, and it is I who have killed you. Fool
that I was to listen to the voice of that temptress, who probably was not
speaking the truth. What are the Talking Bird and the Singing Tree to me in
comparison with you, passionately though I long for them!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Prince Perviz's grief at his brother's loss was
not less than that of Princess Parizade, but he did not waste his time on
useless lamentations. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My sister,&quot; he said, &quot;why should
you think the old woman was deceiving you about these treasures, and what would
have been her object in doing so! No, no, our brother must have met his death
by some accident, or want of precaution, and to-morrow I will start on the same
quest.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Terrified at the thought that she might lose her
only remaining brother, the princess entreated him to give up his project, but
he remained firm. Before setting out, however, he gave her a chaplet of a
hundred pearls, and said, &quot;When I am absent, tell this over daily for me.
But if you should find that the beads stick, so that they will not slip one
after the other, you will know that my brother's fate has befallen me. Still,
we must hope for better luck.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he departed, and on the twentieth day of
his journey fell in with the dervish on the same spot as Prince Bahman had met
him, and began to question him as to the place where the Talking Bird, the
Singing Tree and the Golden Water were to be found. As in the case of his
brother, the dervish tried to make him give up his project, and even told him that
only a few weeks since a young man, bearing a strong resemblance to himself,
had passed that way, but had never come back again. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That, holy dervish,&quot; replied Prince
Perviz, &quot;was my elder brother, who is now dead, though how he died I
cannot say.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He is changed into a black stone,&quot;
answered the dervish, &quot;like all the rest who have gone on the same errand,
and you will become one likewise if you are not more careful in following my
directions.&quot; Then he charged the prince, as he valued his life, to take no
heed of the clamour of voices that would pursue him up the mountain, and
handing him a ball from the bag, which still seemed to be half full, he sent
him on his way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Prince Perviz reached the foot of the
mountain he jumped from his horse, and paused for a moment to recall the
instructions the dervish had given him. Then he strode boldly on, but had
scarcely gone five or six paces when he was startled by a man's voice that
seemed close to his ear, exclaiming: &quot;Stop, rash fellow, and let me punish
your audacity.&quot; This outrage entirely put the dervish's advice out of the
prince's head. He drew his sword, and turned to avenge himself, but almost
before he had realised that there was nobody there, he and his horse were two
black stones. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Not a morning had passed since Prince Perviz had
ridden away without Princess Parizade telling her beads, and at night she even
hung them round her neck, so that if she woke she could assure herself at once
of her brother's safety. She was in the very act of moving them through her
fingers at the moment that the prince fell a victim to his impatience, and her
heart sank when the first pearl remained fixed in its place. However she had
long made up her mind what she would do in such a case, and the following morning
the princess, disguised as a man, set out for the mountain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As she had been accustomed to riding from her
childhood, she managed to travel as many miles daily as her brothers had done,
and it was, as before, on the twentieth day that she arrived at the place where
the dervish was sitting. &quot;Good dervish,&quot; she said politely,
&quot;will you allow me to rest by you for a few moments, and perhaps you will
be so kind as to tell me if you have ever heard of a Talking Bird, a Singing
Tree, and some Golden Water that are to be found somewhere near this?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the dervish,
&quot;for in spite of your manly dress your voice betrays you, I shall be proud
to serve you in any way I can. But may I ask the purpose of your
question?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good dervish,&quot; answered the princess,
&quot;I have heard such glowing descriptions of these three things, that I
cannot rest till I possess them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; said the dervish, &quot;they
are far more beautiful than any description, but you seem ignorant of all the
difficulties that stand in your way, or you would hardly have undertaken such
an adventure. Give it up, I pray you, and return home, and do not ask me to
help you to a cruel death.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Holy father,&quot; answered the princess,
&quot;I come from far, and I should be in despair if I turned back without
having attained my object. You have spoken of difficulties; tell me, I entreat
you, what they are, so that I may know if I can overcome them, or see if they
are beyond my strength.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the dervish repeated his tale, and dwelt more
firmly than before on the clamour of the voices, the horrors of the black
stones, which were once living men, and the difficulties of climbing the
mountain; and pointed out that the chief means of success was never to look
behind till you had the cage in your grasp. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;As far as I can see,&quot; said the
princess, &quot;the first thing is not to mind the tumult of the voices that
follow you till you reach the cage, and then never to look behind. As to this,
I think I have enough self-control to look straight before me; but as it is
quite possible that I might be frightened by the voices, as even the boldest
men have been, I will stop up my ears with cotton, so that, let them make as
much noise as they like, I shall hear nothing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Madam,&quot; cried the dervish, &quot;out
of all the number who have asked me the way to the mountain, you are the first
who has ever suggested such a means of escaping the danger! It is possible that
you may succeed, but all the same, the risk is great.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good dervish,&quot; answered the princess,
&quot;I feel in my heart that I shall succeed, and it only remains for me to
ask you the way I am to go.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the dervish said that it was useless to say
more, and he gave her the ball, which she flung before her. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The first thing the princess did on arriving at
the mountain was to stop her ears with cotton, and then, making up her mind
which was the best way to go, she began her ascent. In spite of the cotton,
some echoes of the voices reached her ears, but not so as to trouble her.
Indeed, though they grew louder and more insulting the higher she climbed, the
princess only laughed, and said to herself that she certainly would not let a
few rough words stand between her and the goal. At last she perceived in the
distance the cage and the bird, whose voice joined itself in tones of thunder
to those of the rest: &quot;Return, return! never dare to come near me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the sight of the bird, the princess hastened
her steps, and without vexing herself at the noise which by this time had grown
deafening, she walked straight up to the cage, and seizing it, she said:
&quot;Now, my bird, I have got you, and I shall take good care that you do not
escape.&quot; As she spoke she took the cotton from her ears, for it was needed
no longer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Brave lady,&quot; answered the bird,
&quot;do not blame me for having joined my voice to those who did their best to
preserve my freedom. Although confined in a cage, I was content with my lot,
but if I must become a slave, I could not wish for a nobler mistress than one
who has shown so much constancy, and from this moment I swear to serve you
faithfully. Some day you will put me to the proof, for I know who you are
better than you do yourself. Meanwhile, tell me what I can do, and I will obey
you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Bird,&quot; replied the princess, who was
filled with a joy that seemed strange to herself when she thought that the bird
had cost her the lives of both her brothers, &quot;bird, let me first thank you
for your good will, and then let me ask you where the Golden Water is to be
found.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bird described the place, which was not far
distant, and the princess filled a small silver flask that she had brought with
her for the purpose. She then returned to the cage, and said: &quot;Bird, there
is still something else, where shall I find the Singing Tree?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Behind you, in that wood,&quot; replied
the bird, and the princess wandered through the wood, till a sound of the
sweetest voices told her she had found what she sought. But the tree was tall
and strong, and it was hopeless to think of uprooting it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You need not do that,&quot; said the bird,
when she had returned to ask counsel. &quot;Break off a twig, and plant it in
your garden, and it will take root, and grow into a magnificent tree.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Princess Parizade held in her hands the
three wonders promised her by the old woman, she said to the bird: &quot;All
that is not enough. It was owing to you that my brothers became black stones. I
cannot tell them from the mass of others, but you must know, and point them out
to me, I beg you, for I wish to carry them away.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For some reason that the princess could not
guess these words seemed to displease the bird, and he did not answer. The
princess waited a moment, and then continued in severe tones, &quot;Have you
forgotten that you yourself said that you are my slave to do my bidding, and
also that your life is in my power?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, I have not forgotten,&quot; replied
the bird, &quot;but what you ask is very difficult. However, I will do my best.
If you look round,&quot; he went on, &quot;you will see a pitcher standing
near. Take it, and, as you go down the mountain, scatter a little of the water
it contains over every black stone and you will soon find your two
brothers.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Princess Parizade took the pitcher, and,
carrying with her besides the cage the twig and the flask, returned down the
mountain side. At every black stone she stopped and sprinkled it with water,
and as the water touched it the stone instantly became a man. When she suddenly
saw her brothers before her her delight was mixed with astonishment. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why, what are you doing here?&quot; she
cried. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We have been asleep,&quot; they said. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned the princess,
&quot;but without me your sleep would probably have lasted till the day of
judgment. Have you forgotten that you came here in search of the Talking Bird,
the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water, and the black stones that were heaped
up along the road? Look round and see if there is one left. These gentlemen,
and yourselves, and all your horses were changed into these stones, and I have
delivered you by sprinkling you with the water from this pitcher. As I could
not return home without you, even though I had gained the prizes on which I had
set my heart, I forced the Talking Bird to tell me how to break the
spell.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On hearing these words Prince Bahman and Prince
Perviz understood all they owed their sister, and the knights who stood by
declared themselves her slaves and ready to carry out her wishes. But the
princess, while thanking them for their politeness, explained that she wished
for no company but that of her brothers, and that the rest were free to go
where they would. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying the princess mounted her horse, and,
declining to allow even Prince Bahman to carry the cage with the Talking Bird,
she entrusted him with the branch of the Singing Tree, while Prince Perviz took
care of the flask containing the Golden Water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then they rode away, followed by the knights and
gentlemen, who begged to be permitted to escort them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It had been the intention of the party to stop
and tell their adventures to the dervish, but they found to their sorrow that
he was dead, whether from old age, or whether from the feeling that his task
was done, they never knew. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As they continued their road their numbers grew
daily smaller, for the knights turned off one by one to their own homes, and
only the brothers and sister finally drew up at the gate of the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess carried the cage straight into the
garden, and, as soon as the bird began to sing, nightingales, larks, thrushes,
finches, and all sorts of other birds mingled their voices in chorus. The
branch she planted in a corner near the house, and in a few days it had grown
into a great tree. As for the Golden Water it was poured into a great marble
basin specially prepared for it, and it swelled and bubbled and then shot up
into the air in a fountain twenty feet high. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fame of these wonders soon spread abroad,
and people came from far and near to see and admire. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a few days Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz
fell back into their ordinary way of life, and passed most of their time
hunting. One day it happened that the Sultan of Persia was also hunting in the
same direction, and, not wishing to interfere with his sport, the young men, on
hearing the noise of the hunt approaching, prepared to retire, but, as luck
would have it, they turned into the very path down which the Sultan was coming.
They threw themselves from their horses and prostrated themselves to the earth,
but the Sultan was curious to see their faces, and commanded them to rise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princes stood up respectfully, but quite at
their ease, and the Sultan looked at them for a few moments without speaking,
then he asked who they were and where they lived. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Prince Bahman,
&quot;we are sons of your Highness's late intendant of the gardens, and we live
in a house that he built a short time before his death, waiting till an
occasion should offer itself to serve your Highness.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You seem fond of hunting,&quot; answered
the Sultan. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Prince Bahman,
&quot;it is our usual exercise, and one that should be neglected by no man who
expects to comply with the ancient customs of the kingdom and bear arms.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was delighted with this remark, and
said at once, &quot;In that case I shall take great pleasure in watching you.
Come, choose what sort of beasts you would like to hunt.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princes jumped on their horses and followed
the Sultan at a little distance. They had not gone very far before they saw a
number of wild animals appear at once, and Prince Bahman started to give chase
to a lion and Prince Perviz to a bear. Both used their javelins with such skill
that, directly they arrived within striking range, the lion and the bear fell,
pierced through and through. Then Prince Perviz pursued a lion and Prince
Bahman a bear, and in a very few minutes they, too, lay dead. As they were
making ready for a third assault the Sultan interfered, and, sending one of his
officials to summon them, he said smiling, &quot;If I let you go on, there will
soon be no beasts left to hunt. Besides, your courage and manners have so won
my heart that I will not have you expose yourselves to further danger. I am
convinced that some day or other I shall find you useful as well as
agreeable.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He then gave them a warm invitation to stay with
him altogether, but with many thanks for the honour done them, they begged to
be excused, and to be suffered to remain at home. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan who was not accustomed to see his
offers rejected inquired their reasons, and Prince Bahman explained that they
did not wish to leave their sister, and were accustomed to do nothing without
consulting all three together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ask her advice, then,&quot; replied the
Sultan, &quot;and to-morrow come and hunt with me, and give me your
answer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two princes returned home, but their
adventure made so little impression on them that they quite forgot to speak to
their sister on the subject. The next morning when they went to hunt they met
the Sultan in the same place, and he inquired what advice their sister had
given. The young men looked at each other and blushed. At last Prince Bahman
said, &quot;Sire, we must throw ourselves on your Highness's mercy. Neither my
brother nor myself remembered anything about it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then be sure you do not forget
to-day,&quot; answered the Sultan, &quot;and bring me back your reply
to-morrow.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When, however, the same thing happened a second
time, they feared that the Sultan might be angry with them for their
carelessness. But he took it in good part, and, drawing three little golden
balls from his purse, he held them out to Prince Bahman, saying, &quot;Put
these in your bosom and you will not forget a third time, for when you remove
your girdle to-night the noise they will make in falling will remind you of my
wishes.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It all happened as the Sultan had foreseen, and
the two brothers appeared in their sister's apartments just as she was in the
act of stepping into bed, and told their tale. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Princess Parizade was much disturbed at the
news, and did not conceal her feelings. &quot;Your meeting with the Sultan is
very honourable to you,&quot; she said, &quot;and will, I dare say, be of
service to you, but it places me in a very awkward position. It is on my
account, I know, that you have resisted the Sultan's wishes, and I am very
grateful to you for it. But kings do not like to have their offers refused, and
in time he would bear a grudge against you, which would render me very unhappy.
Consult the Talking Bird, who is wise and far-seeing, and let me hear what he
says.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the bird was sent for and the case laid
before him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The princes must on no account refuse the
Sultan's proposal,&quot; said he, &quot;and they must even invite him to come
and see your house.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But, bird,&quot; objected the princess,
&quot;you know how dearly we love each other; will not all this spoil our
friendship?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied the bird,
&quot;it will make it all the closer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Then the Sultan will have to see me,&quot;
said the princess. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bird answered that it was necessary that he
should see her, and everything would turn out for the best. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The following morning, when the Sultan inquired
if they had spoken to their sister and what advice she had given them, Prince
Bahman replied that they were ready to agree to his Highness's wishes, and that
their sister had reproved them for their hesitation about the matter. The
Sultan received their excuses with great kindness, and told them that he was
sure they would be equally faithful to him, and kept them by his side for the
rest of the day, to the vexation of the grand-vizir and the rest of the court. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the procession entered in this order the
gates of the capital, the eyes of the people who crowded the streets were fixed
on the two young men, strangers to every one. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, if only the Sultan had had sons like
that!&quot; they murmured, &quot;they look so distinguished and are about the
same age that his sons would have been!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan commanded that splendid apartments
should be prepared for the two brothers, and even insisted that they should sit
at table with him. During dinner he led the conversation to various scientific
subjects, and also to history, of which he was especially fond, but whatever
topic they might be discussing he found that the views of the young men were
always worth listening to. &quot;If they were my own sons,&quot; he said to
himself, &quot;they could not be better educated!&quot; and aloud he
complimented them on their learning and taste for knowledge. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At the end of the evening the princes once more
prostrated themselves before the throne and asked leave to return home; and
then, encouraged by the gracious words of farewell uttered by the Sultan,
Prince Bahman said: &quot;Sire, may we dare to take the liberty of asking
whether you would do us and our sister the honour of resting for a few minutes
at our house the first time the hunt passes that way?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;With the utmost pleasure,&quot; replied
the Sultan; &quot;and as I am all impatience to see the sister of such
accomplished young men you may expect me the day after to-morrow.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess was of course most anxious to
entertain the Sultan in a fitting way, but as she had no experience in court
customs she ran to the Talking Bird, and begged he would advise her as to what
dishes should be served. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My dear mistress,&quot; replied the bird,
&quot;your cooks are very good and you can safely leave all to them, except
that you must be careful to have a dish of cucumbers, stuffed with pearl sauce,
served with the first course.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Cucumbers stuffed with pearls!&quot;
exclaimed the princess. &quot;Why, bird, who ever heard of such a dish? The
Sultan will expect a dinner he can eat, and not one he can only admire!
Besides, if I were to use all the pearls I possess, they would not be half
enough.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Mistress,&quot; replied the bird, &quot;do
what I tell you and nothing but good will come of it. And as to the pearls, if
you go at dawn to-morrow and dig at the foot of the first tree in the park, on
the right hand, you will find as many as you want.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess had faith in the bird, who
generally proved to be right, and taking the gardener with her early next
morning followed out his directions carefully. After digging for some time they
came upon a golden box fastened with little clasps. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>These were easily undone, and the box was found
to be full of pearls, not very large ones, but well-shaped and of a good
colour. So leaving the gardener to fill up the hole he had made under the tree,
the princess took up the box and returned to the house. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two princes had seen her go out, and had
wondered what could have made her rise so early. Full of curiosity they got up
and dressed, and met their sister as she was returning with the box under her
arm. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What have you been doing?&quot; they
asked, &quot;and did the gardener come to tell you he had found a
treasure?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;On the contrary,&quot; replied the
princess, &quot;it is I who have found one,&quot; and opening the box she
showed her astonished brothers the pearls inside. Then, on the way back to the
palace, she told them of her consultation with the bird, and the advice it had
given her. All three tried to guess the meaning of the singular counsel, but
they were forced at last to admit the explanation was beyond them, and they
must be content blindly to obey. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The first thing the princess did on entering the
palace was to send for the head cook and to order the repast for the Sultan
When she had finished she suddenly added, &quot;Besides the dishes I have
mentioned there is one that you must prepare expressly for the Sultan, and that
no one must touch but yourself. It consists of a stuffed cucumber, and the stuffing
is to be made of these pearls.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The head cook, who had never in all his
experience heard of such a dish, stepped back in amazement. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You think I am mad,&quot; answered the
princess, who perceived what was in his mind. &quot;But I know quite well what
I am doing. Go, and do your best, and take the pearls with you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning the princes started for the
forest, and were soon joined by the Sultan. The hunt began and continued till
mid-day, when the heat became so great that they were obliged to leave off.
Then, as arranged, they turned their horses' heads towards the palace, and
while Prince Bahman remained by the side of the Sultan, Prince Perviz rode on
to warn his sister of their approach. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The moment his Highness entered the courtyard,
the princess flung herself at his feet, but he bent and raised her, and gazed
at her for some time, struck with her grace and beauty, and also with the
indefinable air of courts that seemed to hang round this country girl.
&quot;They are all worthy one of the other,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;and
I am not surprised that they think so much of her opinions. I must know more of
them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By this time the princess had recovered from the
first embarrassment of meeting, and proceeded to make her speech of welcome. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is only a simple country house,
sire,&quot; she said, &quot;suitable to people like ourselves, who live a quiet
life. It cannot compare with the great city mansions, much less, of course,
with the smallest of the Sultan's palaces.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I cannot quite agree with you,&quot; he
replied; &quot;even the little that I have seen I admire greatly, and I will
reserve my judgment until you have shown me the whole.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The princess then led the way from room to room,
and the Sultan examined everything carefully. &quot;Do you call this a simple
country house?&quot; he said at last. &quot;Why, if every country house was
like this, the towns would soon be deserted. I am no longer astonished that you
do not wish to leave it. Let us go into the gardens, which I am sure are no
less beautiful than the rooms.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A small door opened straight into the garden,
and the first object that met the Sultan's eyes was the Golden Water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What lovely coloured water!&quot; he
exclaimed; &quot;where is the spring, and how do you make the fountain rise so
high? I do not believe there is anything like it in the world.&quot; He went
forward to examine it, and when he had satisfied his curiosity, the princess
conducted him towards the Singing Tree. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As they drew near, the Sultan was startled by
the sound of strange voices, but could see nothing. &quot;Where have you hidden
your musicians?&quot; he asked the princess; &quot;are they up in the air, or
under the earth? Surely the owners of such charming voices ought not to conceal
themselves!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the princess,
&quot;the voices all come from the tree which is straight in front of us; and
if you will deign to advance a few steps, you will see that they become
clearer.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan did as he was told, and was so wrapt
in delight at what he heard that he stood some time in silence. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell me, madam, I pray you,&quot; he said
at last, &quot;how this marvellous tree came into your garden? It must have
been brought from a great distance, or else, fond as I am of all curiosities, I
could not have missed hearing of it! What is its name?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The only name it has, sire,&quot; replied
she, &quot;is the Singing Tree, and it is not a native of this country. Its
history is mixed up with those of the Golden Water and the Talking Bird, which
you have not yet seen. If your Highness wishes I will tell you the whole story,
when you have recovered from your fatigue.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Indeed, madam,&quot; returned he,
&quot;you show me so many wonders that it is impossible to feel any fatigue.
Let us go once more and look at the Golden Water; and I am dying to see the
Talking Bird.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan could hardly tear himself away from
the Golden Water, which puzzled him more and more. &quot;You say,&quot; he
observed to the princess, &quot;that this water does not come from any spring,
neither is brought by pipes. All I understand is, that neither it nor the
Singing Tree is a native of this country.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is as you say, sire,&quot; answered the
princess, &quot;and if you examine the basin, you will see that it is all in
one piece, and therefore the water could not have been brought through it. What
is more astonishing is, that I only emptied a small flaskful into the basin,
and it increased to the quantity you now see.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, I will look at it no more
to-day,&quot; said the Sultan. &quot;Take me to the Talking Bird.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On approaching the house, the Sultan noticed a
vast quantity of birds, whose voices filled the air, and he inquired why they
were so much more numerous here than in any other part of the garden. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the princess,
&quot;do you see that cage hanging in one of the windows of the saloon? that is
the Talking Bird, whose voice you can hear above them all, even above that of
the nightingale. And the birds crowd to this spot, to add their songs to
his.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan stepped through the window, but the
bird took no notice, continuing his song as before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My slave,&quot; said the princess,
&quot;this is the Sultan; make him a pretty speech.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The bird stopped singing at once, and all the
other birds stopped too. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The Sultan is welcome,&quot; he said.
&quot;I wish him long life and all prosperity.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I thank you, good bird,&quot; answered the
Sultan, seating himself before the repast, which was spread at a table near the
window, &quot;and I am enchanted to see in you the Sultan and King of the
Birds.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan, noticing that his favourite dish of
cucumber was placed before him, proceeded to help himself to it, and was amazed
to and that the stuffing was of pearls. &quot;A novelty, indeed!&quot; cried
he, &quot;but I do not understand the reason of it; one cannot eat
pearls!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the bird, before
either the princes or the princess could speak, &quot;surely your Highness
cannot be so surprised at beholding a cucumber stuffed with pearls, when you
believed without any difficulty that the Sultana had presented you, instead of
children, with a dog, a cat, and a log of wood.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I believed it,&quot; answered the Sultan,
&quot;because the women attending on her told me so.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The women, sire,&quot; said the bird,
&quot;were the sisters of the Sultana, who were devoured with jealousy at the
honour you had done her, and in order to revenge themselves invented this
story. Have them examined, and they will confess their crime. These are your
children, who were saved from death by the intendant of your gardens, and
brought up by him as if they were his own.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Like a flash the truth came to the mind of the
Sultan. &quot;Bird,&quot; he cried, &quot;my heart tells me that what you say
is true. My children,&quot; he added, &quot;let me embrace you, and embrace
each other, not only as brothers and sister, but as having in you the blood
royal of Persia which could flow in no nobler veins.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the first moments of emotion were over, the
Sultan hastened to finish his repast, and then turning to his children he
exclaimed: &quot;To-day you have made acquaintance with your father. To-morrow
I will bring you the Sultana your mother. Be ready to receive her.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan then mounted his horse and rode
quickly back to the capital. Without an instant's delay he sent for the
grand-vizir, and ordered him to seize and question the Sultana's sisters that
very day. This was done. They were confronted with each other and proved
guilty, and were executed in less than an hour. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the Sultan did not wait to hear that his
orders had been carried out before going on foot, followed by his whole court
to the door of the great mosque, and drawing the Sultana with his own hand out
of the narrow prison where she had spent so many years, &quot;Madam,&quot; he
cried, embracing her with tears in his eyes, &quot;I have come to ask your
pardon for the injustice I have done you, and to repair it as far as I may. I
have already begun by punishing the authors of this abominable crime, and I
hope you will forgive me when I introduce you to our children, who are the most
charming and accomplished creatures in the whole world. Come with me, and take
back your position and all the honour that is due to you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This speech was delivered in the presence of a
vast multitude of people, who had gathered from all parts on the first hint of
what was happening, and the news was passed from mouth to mouth in a few
seconds. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Early next day the Sultan and Sultana, dressed
in robes of state and followed by all the court, set out for the country house
of their children. Here the Sultan presented them to the Sultana one by one,
and for some time there was nothing but embraces and tears and tender words.
Then they ate of the magnificent dinner which had been prepared for them, and
after they were all refreshed they went into the garden, where the Sultan
pointed out to his wife the Golden Water and the Singing Tree. As to the
Talking Bird, she had already made acquaintance with him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the evening they rode together back to the
