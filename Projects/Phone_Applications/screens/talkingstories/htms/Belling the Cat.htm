<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Long ago, the mice had a general council to
consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.
Some said this, and some said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said
he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet the case. &quot;You will
all agree,&quot; said he, &quot;that our chief danger consists in the sly and
treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive
some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her. I venture,
therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon
round the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when she was
about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood.&quot; This
proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said:
&quot;That is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?&quot; The mice looked
at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mouse said: &quot;It is easy to
propose impossible remedies.&quot;</span></p>
