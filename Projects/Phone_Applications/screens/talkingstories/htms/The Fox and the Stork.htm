<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At one time the Fox and the Stork were on
visiting terms and seemed very good friends. So the Fox invited the Stork to
dinner, and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow
dish. This the Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end of
her long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began. &quot;I am
sorry,&quot; said the Fox, &quot;the soup is not to your liking.&quot;
&quot;Pray do not apologise,&quot; said the Stork. &quot;I hope you will return
this visit, and come and dine with me soon.&quot; So a day was appointed when
the Fox should visit the Stork; but when they were seated at table all that was
for their dinner was contained in a very long-necked jar with a narrow mouth,
in which the Fox could not insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was
to lick the outside of the jar. &quot;I will not apologise for the
dinner,&quot; said the Stork: &quot;One bad turn deserves another.&quot;</span></p>
