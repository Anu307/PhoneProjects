font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Patty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying
her milk in a Pail on her head. As she went along she began calculating what
she would do with the money she would get for the milk. &quot;I'll buy some
fowls from Farmer Brown,&quot; said she, &quot;and they will lay eggs each
morning, which I will sell to the parson's wife. With the money that I get from
the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and
when I go to market, won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Polly
Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss
my head like this. As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it,
and all the milk was spilt. So she had to go home and tell her mother what had
occurred. &quot;Ah, my child,&quot; said the mother, &quot;Do not count your
chickens before they are hatched.&quot;</span></p>
