font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Lion once gave out that he was sick unto
death and summoned the animals to come and hear his last Will and Testament. So
the Goat came to the Lion's cave, and stopped there listening for a long time.
Then a Sheep went in, and before she came out a Calf came up to receive the
last wishes of the Lord of the Beasts. But soon the Lion seemed to recover, and
came to the mouth of his cave, and saw the Fox, who had been waiting outside
for some time. &quot;Why do you not come to pay your respects to me?&quot; said
the Lion to the Fox. &quot;I beg your Majesty's pardon,&quot; said the Fox,
&quot;but I noticed the track of the animals that have already come to you; and
while I see many hoof-marks going in, I see none coming out. Till the animals
that have entered your cave come out again I prefer to remain in the open
air.&quot; It is easier to get into the enemy's toils than out again.</span></p>
