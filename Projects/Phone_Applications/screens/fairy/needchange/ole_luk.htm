      <b><big><img src="pics/T.png" alt="T" width="41" height="28" align=

      so many stories as Ole-Luk-Oie, or who can relate them so nicely. In the
      evening, while the children are seated at the table or in their little
      chairs, he comes up the stairs very softly, for he walks in his socks,
      then he opens the doors without the slightest noise, and throws a small
      quantity of very fine dust in their eyes, just enough to prevent them
      from keeping them open, and so they do not see him. Then he creeps behind
      them, and blows softly upon their necks, <img src="pics/ole_luk.jpg"
      width="357" height="219" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" border="1"
      alt="" /> till their heads begin to droop. But Ole-Luk-Oie does not wish
      to hurt them, for he is very fond of children, and only wants them to be
      quiet that he may relate to them pretty stories, and they never are quiet
      until they are in bed and asleep. As soon as they are asleep, Ole-Luk-Oie
      seats himself upon the bed. He is nicely dressed; his coat is made of
      silken stuff; it is impossible to say of what color, for it changes from
      green to red, and from red to blue as he turns from side to side. Under
      each arm he carries an umbrella; one of them, with pictures on the
      inside, he spreads over the good children, and then they dream the most
      beautiful stories the whole night. But the other umbrella has no
      pictures, and this he holds over the naughty children so that they sleep
      heavily, and wake in the morning without having dreamed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we shall hear how Ole-Luk-Oie came every night during a whole week to
      the little boy named Hjalmar, and what he told him. There were seven
      stories, as there are seven days in the week.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">
      <a name="1">Monday</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent">
      <b><big><img src="pics/N.png" alt="“N" width="29" height="35" align=
      "left" /></big><small>OW</small></b> pay attention,” said Ole-Luk-Oie, in
      the evening, when Hjalmar was in bed, “and I will decorate the room.”
      <img src="pics/ole_luk1.jpg" width="289" height="215" vspace="10" hspace=
      "10" align="right" border="1" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately all the flowers in the flower-pots became large trees, with
      long branches reaching to the ceiling, and stretching along the walls, so
      that the whole room was like a greenhouse. All the branches were loaded
      with flowers, each flower as beautiful and as fragrant as a rose; and,
      had any one tasted them, he would have found them sweeter even than jam.
      The fruit glittered like gold, and there were cakes so full of plums that
      they were nearly bursting. It was incomparably beautiful. At the same
      time sounded dismal moans from the table-drawer in which lay Hjalmar’s
      school books.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What can that be now?” said Ole-Luk-Oie, going to the table and pulling
      out the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a slate, in such distress because of a false number in the sum,
      that it had almost broken itself to pieces. The pencil pulled and tugged
      at its string as if it were a little dog that wanted to help, but could
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came a moan from Hjalmar’s copy-book. Oh, it was quite terrible
      to hear! On each leaf stood a row of capital letters, every one having a
      small letter by its side. This formed a copy; under these were other
      letters, which Hjalmar had written: they fancied they looked like the
      copy, but they were mistaken; for they were leaning on one side as if
      they intended to fall over the pencil-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See, this is the way you should hold yourselves,” said the copy. “Look
      here, you should slope thus, with a graceful curve.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, we are very willing to do so, but we cannot,” said Hjalmar’s
      letters; “we are so wretchedly made.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must be scratched out, then,” said Ole-Luk-Oie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no!” they cried, and then they stood up so gracefully it was quite a
      pleasure to look at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now we must give up our stories, and exercise these letters,” said
      Ole-Luk-Oie; “One, two—one, two—” So he drilled them till they stood up
      gracefully, and looked as beautiful as a copy could look. But after
      Ole-Luk-Oie was gone, and Hjalmar looked at them in the morning, they
      were as wretched and as awkward as ever.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">
      <a name="2">Tuesday</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent">
      <b><big><img src="pics/A.png" alt="A" width="35" height="27" align=
      "left" /></big><small>S</small></b> soon as Hjalmar was in bed,
      Ole-Luk-Oie touched, with his little magic wand, all the furniture in the
      room, which immediately began to chatter, and each article only talked of
      itself. <img src="pics/ole_luk2.jpg" width="358" height="187" vspace="10"
      hspace="10" align="right" border="1" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the chest of drawers hung a large picture in a gilt frame,
      representing a landscape, with fine old trees, flowers in the grass, and
      a broad stream, which flowed through the wood, past several castles, far
      out into the wild ocean. Ole-Luk-Oie touched the picture with his magic
      wand, and immediately the birds commenced singing, the branches of the
      trees rustled, and the clouds moved across the sky, casting their shadows
      on the landscape beneath them. Then Ole-Luk-Oie lifted little Hjalmar up
      to the frame, and placed his feet in the picture, just on the high grass,
      and there he stood with the sun shining down upon him through the
      branches of the trees. He ran to the water, and seated himself in a
      little boat which lay there, and which was painted red and white. The
      sails glittered like silver, and six swans, each with a golden circlet
      round its neck, and a bright blue star on its forehead, drew the boat
      past the green wood, where the trees talked of robbers and witches, and
      the flowers of beautiful little elves and fairies, whose histories the
      butterflies had related to them. Brilliant fish, with scales like silver
      and gold, swam after the boat, sometimes making a spring and splashing
      the water round them, while birds, red and blue, small and great, flew
      after him in two long lines. The gnats danced round them, and the
      cockchafers cried “Buz, buz.” They all wanted to follow Hjalmar, and all
      had some story to tell him. It was a most pleasant sail. Sometimes the
      forests were thick and dark, sometimes like a beautiful garden, gay with
      sunshine and flowers; then he passed great palaces of glass and of
      marble, and on the balconies stood princesses, whose faces were those of
      little girls whom Hjalmar knew well, and had often played with. One of
      them held out her hand, in which was a heart made of sugar, more
      beautiful than any confectioner ever sold. As Hjalmar sailed by, he
      caught hold of one side of the sugar heart, and held it fast, and the
      princess held fast also, so that it broke in two pieces. Hjalmar had one
      piece, and the princess the other, but Hjalmar’s was the largest. At each
      castle stood little princes acting as sentinels. They presented arms, and
      had golden swords, and made it rain plums and tin soldiers, so that they
      must have been real princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hjalmar continued to sail, sometimes through woods, sometimes as it were
      through large halls, and then by large cities. At last he came to the
      town where his nurse lived, who had carried him in her arms when he was a
      very little boy, and had always been kind to him. She nodded and beckoned
      to him, and then sang the little verses she had herself composed and set
      to him,—
    </p>
    <blockquote class="small">
      “How oft my memory turns to thee,
      <div class="indent">
        My own Hjalmar, ever dear!
      </div>When I could watch thy infant glee,
      <div class="indent">
        Or kiss away a pearly tear.
      </div>’Twas in my arms thy lisping tongue
      <div class="indent">
        First spoke the half-remembered word,
      </div>While o’er thy tottering steps I hung,
      <div class="indent">
        My fond protection to afford.
      </div>Farewell! I pray the Heavenly Power<br />
      To keep thee till thy dying hour.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And all the birds sang the same tune, the flowers danced on their stems,
      and the old trees nodded as if Ole-Luk-Oie had been telling them stories
      as well.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">
      <a name="3">Wednesday</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent">
      <b><big><img src="pics/H.png" alt="H" width="33" height="27" align=
      "left" /></big><small>OW</small></b> the rain did pour down! Hjalmar
      could hear it in his sleep;. and when Ole-Luk-Oie opened the window, the
      water flowed quite up to the window-sill. It had the appearance of a
      large lake outside, and a beautiful ship lay close to the house.
      <img src="pics/ole_luk3.jpg" width="373" height="181" vspace="10" hspace=
      "10" align="right" border="1" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wilt thou sail with me to-night, little Hjalmar?” said Ole-Luk-Oie;
      “then we shall see foreign countries, and thou shalt return here in the
      morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All in a moment, there stood Hjalmar, in his best clothes, on the deck of
      the noble ship; and immediately the weather became fine. They sailed
      through the streets, round by the church, and on every side rolled the
      wide, great sea. They sailed till the land disappeared, and then they saw
      a flock of storks, who had left their own country, and were travelling to
      warmer climates. The storks flew one behind the other, and had already
      been a long, long time on the wing. One of them seemed so tired that his
      wings could scarcely carry him. He was the last of the row, and was soon
      left very far behind. At length he sunk lower and lower, with
      outstretched wings, flapping them in vain, till his feet touched the
      rigging of the ship, and he slided from the sails to the deck, and stood
      before them. Then a sailor-boy caught him, and put him in the hen-house,
      with the fowls, the ducks, and the turkeys, while the poor stork stood
      quite bewildered amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just look at that fellow,” said the chickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the turkey-cock puffed himself out as large as he could, and
      inquired who he was; and the ducks waddled backwards, crying, “Quack,
      quack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the stork told them all about warm Africa, of the pyramids, and of
      the ostrich, which, like a wild horse, runs across the desert. But the
      ducks did not understand what he said, and quacked amongst themselves,
      “We are all of the same opinion; namely, that he is stupid.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, to be sure, he is stupid,” said the turkey-cock; and gobbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the stork remained quite silent, and thought of his home in Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those are handsome thin legs of yours,” said the turkey-cock. “What do
      they cost a yard?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quack, quack, quack,” grinned the ducks; but, the stork pretended not to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may as well laugh,” said the turkey; “for that remark was rather
      witty, or perhaps it was above you. Ah, ah, is he not clever? He will be
      a great amusement to us while he remains here.” And then he gobbled, and
      the ducks quacked, “Gobble, gobble; Quack, quack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What a terrible uproar they made, while they were having such fun among
      themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hjalmar went to the hen-house; and, opening the door, called to the
      stork. Then he hopped out on the deck. He had rested himself now, and he
      looked happy, and seemed as if he nodded to Hjalmar, as if to thank him.
      Then he spread his wings, and flew away to warmer countries, while the
      hens clucked, the ducks quacked, and the turkey-cock turned quite scarlet
      in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To-morrow you shall be made into soup,” said Hjalmar to the fowls; and
      then he awoke, and found himself lying in his little bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful journey which Ole-Luk-Oie had made him take this
      night.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">
      <a name="4">Thursday</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent">
      <b><big><img src="pics/W.png" alt="“W" width="51" height="35" align=
      "left" /></big><small>HAT</small></b> do you think I have got here?” said
      Ole-Luk-Oie, “Do not be frightened, and you shall see a little mouse.”
      And then he held out his hand to him, in which lay a lovely little
      creature. “It has come to invite you to a wedding. Two little mice are
      going to enter into the marriage state tonight. They reside under the
      floor of your mother’s store-room, and that must be a fine
      dwelling-place.” <img src="pics/ole_luk4.jpg" width="339" height="133"
      vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" border="1" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how can I get through the little mouse-hole in the floor?” asked
      Hjalmar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leave me to manage that,” said Ole-Luk-Oie. “I will soon make you small
      enough.” And then he touched Hjalmar with his magic wand, whereupon he
      became less and less, until at last he was not longer than a little
      finger. “Now you can borrow the dress of the tin soldier. I think it will
      just fit you. It looks well to wear a uniform when you go into company.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, certainly,” said Hjalmar; and in a moment he was dressed as neatly
      as the neatest of all tin soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you be so good as to seat yourself in your mamma’s thimble,” said
      the little mouse, “that I may have the pleasure of drawing you to the
      wedding.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you really take so much trouble, young lady?” said Hjalmar. And so
      in this way he rode to the mouse’s wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      First they went under the floor, and then passed through a long passage,
      which was scarcely high enough to allow the thimble to drive under, and
      the whole passage was lit up with the phosphorescent light of rotten
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does it not smell delicious?” asked the mouse, as she drew him along.
      “The wall and the floor have been smeared with bacon-rind; nothing can be
      nicer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon they arrived at the bridal hall. On the right stood all the
      little lady-mice, whispering and giggling, as if they were making game of
      each other. To the left were the gentlemen-mice, stroking their whiskers
      with their fore-paws; and in the centre of the hall could be seen the
      bridal pair, standing side by side, in a hollow cheese-rind, and kissing
      each other, while all eyes were upon them; for they had already been
      betrothed, and were soon to be married. More and more friends kept
      arriving, till the mice were nearly treading each other to death; for the
      bridal pair now stood in the doorway, and none could pass in or out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room had been rubbed over with bacon-rind, like the passage, which
      was all the refreshment offered to the guests. But for dessert they
      produced a pea, on which a mouse belonging to the bridal pair had bitten
      the first letters of their names. This was something quite uncommon. All
      the mice said it was a very beautiful wedding, and that they had been
      very agreeably entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Hjalmar returned home. He had certainly been in grand
      society; but he had been obliged to creep under a room, and to make
      himself small enough to wear the uniform of a tin soldier.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">
      <a name="5">Friday</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent">
      <b><big><img src="pics/I.png" alt="“I" width="33" height="29" align=
      "left" /></big><small>T</small></b> is incredible how many old people
      there are who would be glad to have me at night,” said Ole-Luk-Oie,
      “especially those who have done something wrong. ‘Good little Ole,’ say
      they to me, ‘we cannot close our eyes, and we lie awake the whole night
      and see all our evil deeds sitting on our beds like little imps, and
      sprinkling us with hot water. Will you come and drive them away, that we
      may have a good night’s rest?’ and then they sigh so deeply and say, ‘We
      would gladly pay you for it. Good-night, Ole-Luk, the money lies on the
      window.’ But I never do anything for gold.” “What shall we do to-night?”
      asked Hjalmar. “I do not know whether you would care to go to another
      wedding,” he replied, “although it is quite a different affair to the one
      we saw last night. Your sister’s large doll, that is dressed like a man,
      and is called Herman, intends to marry the doll Bertha. It is also the
      dolls’ birthday, and they will receive many presents.” <img src=
      "pics/ole_luk5.jpg" width="362" height="228" vspace="10" hspace="10"
      align="right" border="1" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I know that already,” said Hjalmar, “my sister always allows her
      dolls to keep their birthdays or to have a wedding when they require new
      clothes; that has happened already a hundred times, I am quite sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, so it may; but to-night is the hundred and first wedding, and when
      that has taken place it must be the last, therefore this is to be
      extremely beautiful. Only look.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hjalmar looked at the table, and there stood the little card-board doll’s
      house, with lights in all the windows, and drawn up before it were the
      tin soldiers presenting arms. The bridal pair were seated on the floor,
      leaning against the leg of the table, looking very thoughtful, and with
      good reason. Then Ole-Luk-Oie dressed up in grandmother’s black gown
      married them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the ceremony was concluded, all the furniture in the room
      joined in singing a beautiful song, which had been composed by the lead
      pencil, and which went to the melody of a military tattoo.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="small">
      “What merry sounds are on the wind,<br />
      As marriage rites together bind<br />
      A quiet and a loving pair,<br />
      Though formed of kid, yet smooth and fair!<br />
      Hurrah! If they are deaf and blind,<br />
      We’ll sing, though weather prove unkind.”<br />
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And now came the present; but the bridal pair had nothing to eat, for
      love was to be their food.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we go to a country house, or travel?” asked the bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they consulted the swallow who had travelled so far, and the old hen
      in the yard, who had brought up five broods of chickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the swallow talked to them of warm countries, where the grapes hang
      in large clusters on the vines, and the air is soft and mild, and about
      the mountains glowing with colors more beautiful than we can think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they have no red cabbage like we have,” said the hen, “I was once in
      the country with my chickens for a whole summer, there was a large
      sand-pit, in which we could walk about and scratch as we liked. Then we
      got into a garden in which grew red cabbage; oh, how nice it was, I
      cannot think of anything more delicious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But one cabbage stalk is exactly like another,” said the swallow; “and
      here we have often bad weather.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but we are accustomed to it,” said the hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is so cold here, and freezes sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cold weather is good for cabbages,” said the hen; “besides we do have it
      warm here sometimes. Four years ago, we had a summer that lasted more
      than five weeks, and it was so hot one could scarcely breathe. And then
      in this country we have no poisonous animals, and we are free from
      robbers. He must be wicked who does not consider our country the finest
      of all lands. He ought not to be allowed to live here.” And then the hen
      wept very much and said, “I have also travelled. I once went twelve miles
      in a coop, and it was not pleasant travelling at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The hen is a sensible woman,” said the doll Bertha. “I don’t care for
      travelling over mountains, just to go up and come down again. No, let us
      go to the sand-pit in front of the gate, and then take a walk in the
      cabbage garden.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they settled it.

      <b><big><img src="pics/A.png" alt="“A" width="35" height="27" align=

      little Hjalmar, as soon as Ole-Luk-Oie had sent him to sleep. <img src=

    <p>
      “We shall have no time this evening,” said he, spreading out his
      prettiest umbrella over the child. “Look at these Chinese,” and then the
      whole umbrella appeared like a large china bowl, with blue trees and
      pointed bridges, upon which stood little Chinamen nodding their heads.
      “We must make all the world beautiful for to-morrow morning,” said
      Ole-Luk-Oie, “for it will be a holiday, it is Sunday. I must now go to
      the church steeple and see if the little sprites who live there have
      polished the bells, so that they may sound sweetly. Then I must go into
      the fields and see if the wind has blown the dust from the grass and the
      leaves, and the most difficult task of all which I have to do, is to take
      down all the stars and brighten them up. I have to number them first
      before I put them in my apron, and also to number the places from which I
      take them, so that they may go back into the right holes, or else they
      would not remain, and we should have a number of falling stars, for they
      would all tumble down one after the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hark ye! Mr. Luk-Oie,” said an old portrait which hung on the wall of
      Hjalmar’s bedroom. “Do you know me? I am Hjalmar’s great-grandfather. I
      thank you for telling the boy stories, but you must not confuse his
      ideas. The stars cannot be taken down from the sky and polished; they are
      spheres like our earth, which is a good thing for them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, old great-grandfather,” said Ole-Luk-Oie. “I thank you; you
      may be the head of the family, as no doubt you are, but I am older than
      you. I am an ancient heathen. The old Romans and Greeks named me the
      Dream-god. I have visited the noblest houses, and continue to do so;
      still I know how to conduct myself both to high and low, and now you may
      tell the stories yourself:” and so Ole-Luk-Oie walked off, taking his
      umbrellas with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well, one is never to give an opinion, I suppose,” grumbled the
      portrait. And it woke Hjalmar.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">
      <a name="7">Sunday</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent">
      <b><big><img src="pics/G.png" alt="“G" width="40" height="33" align=
      "left" /></big><small>OOD</small></b> evening,” said Ole-Luk-Oie.
      <img src="pics/ole_luk7.jpg" width="316" height="242" vspace="10" hspace=
      "10" align="right" border="1" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Hjalmar nodded, and then sprang out of bed, and turned his
      great-grandfather’s portrait to the wall, so that it might not interrupt
      them as it had done yesterday. “Now,” said he, “you must tell me some
      stories about five green peas that lived in one pod; or of the chickseed
      that courted the chickweed; or of the darning needle, who acted so
      proudly because she fancied herself an embroidery needle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may have too much of a good thing,” said Ole-Luk-Oie. “You know that
      I like best to show you something, so I will show you my brother. He is
      also called Ole-Luk-Oie but he never visits any one but once, and when he
      does come, he takes him away on his horse, and tells him stories as they
      ride along. He knows only two stories. One of these is so wonderfully
      beautiful, that no one in the world can imagine anything at all like it;
      but the other is just as ugly and frightful, so that it would be
      impossible to describe it.” Then Ole-Luk-Oie lifted Hjalmar up to the
      window. “There now, you can see my brother, the other Ole-Luk-Oie; he is
      also called Death. You perceive he is not so bad as they represent him in
      picture books; there he is a skeleton, but now his coat is embroidered
      with silver, and he wears the splendid uniform of a hussar, and a mantle
      of black velvet flies behind him, over the horse. Look, how he gallops
      along.” Hjalmar saw that as this Ole-Luk-Oie rode on, he lifted up old
      and young, and carried them away on his horse. Some he seated in front of
      him, and some behind, but always inquired first, “How stands the
      mark-book?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good,” they all answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but let me see for myself,” he replied; and they were obliged to
      give him the books. Then all those who had “Very good,” or “Exceedingly
      good,” came in front of the horse, and heard the beautiful story; while
      those who had “Middling,” or “Tolerably good,” in their books, were
      obliged to sit behind, and listen to the frightful tale. They trembled
      and cried, and wanted to jump down from the horse, but they could not get
      free, for they seemed fastened to the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, Death is a most splendid Luk-Oie,” said Hjalmar. “I am not in the
      least afraid of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You need have no fear of him,” said Ole-Luk-Oie, “if you take care and
      keep a good conduct book.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now I call that very instructive,” murmured the great-grandfather’s
      portrait. “It is useful sometimes to express an opinion;” so he was quite
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some of the doings and sayings of Ole-Luk-Oie. I hope he may
      visit you himself this evening, and relate some more.
