      <b><big><img src="pics/H.png" alt="H" width="33" height="27" align=

      cupboard quite black with age, and ornamented with carved foliage and
      curious figures? Well, just such a cupboard stood in a parlor, and had
      been left to the family as a legacy by the great-grandmother. It was
      covered from top to bottom with carved roses and tulips; the most curious
      scrolls were drawn upon it, and out of them peeped little stags’ heads,
      with antlers. In the middle of the cupboard door was the carved figure of
      a man most ridiculous to look at. He grinned at you, for no one could
      call it laughing. He had goat’s legs, little horns on his head, and a
      long beard; the children in the room always called him, “Major
      general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat’s-legs.” It was certainly a
      very difficult name to pronounce, and there are very few who ever receive
      such a title, but then it seemed wonderful how he came to be carved at
      all; yet there he was, always looking at the table under the
      looking-glass, where stood a very pretty little shepherdess made of
      china. Her shoes were gilt, and her dress had a red rose or an ornament.
      She wore a hat, and carried a crook, that were both gilded, and looked
      very bright and pretty. Close by her side stood a little chimney-sweep,
      as black as coal, and also made of china. He was, however, quite as clean
      and neat as any other china figure; he only represented a black
      chimney-sweep, and the china workers might just as well have made him a
      prince, had they felt inclined to do so. He stood holding his ladder
      quite handily, and his face was as fair and rosy as a girl’s; indeed,
      that was rather a mistake, it should have had some black marks on it. He
      and the shepherdess had been placed close together, side by side; and,
      being so placed, they became engaged to each other, for they were very
      well suited, being both made of the same sort of china, and being equally
      fragile. Close to them stood another figure, three times as large as they
      were, and also made of china. He was an old Chinaman, who could nod his
      head, and used to pretend that he was the grandfather of the shepherdess,
      although he could not prove it. He however assumed authority over her,
      and therefore when “Major-general-field-sergeant-commander
      Billy-goat’s-legs” asked for the little shepherdess to be his wife, he
      nodded his head to show that he consented. “You will have a husband,”
      said the old Chinaman to her, “who I really believe is made of mahogany.
      He will make you a lady of Major-general-field-sergeant-commander
      Billy-goat’s-legs. He has the whole cupboard full of silver plate, which
      he keeps locked up in secret drawers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I won’t go into the dark cupboard,” said the little shepherdess. “I have
      heard that he has eleven china wives there already.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you shall be the twelfth,” said the old Chinaman. “To-night as soon
      as you hear a rattling in the old cupboard, you shall be married, as true
      as I am a Chinaman;” and then he nodded his head and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart, the
      china chimney-sweep. “I must entreat you,” said she, “to go out with me
      into the wide world, for we cannot stay here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do whatever you wish,” said the little chimney-sweep; “let us go
      immediately: I think I shall be able to maintain you with my profession.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If we were but safely down from the table!” said she; “I shall not be
      happy till we are really out in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he comforted her, and showed her how to place her little foot on the
      carved edge and gilt-leaf ornaments of the table. He brought his little
      ladder to help her, and so they contrived to reach the floor. But when
      they looked at the old cupboard, they saw it was all in an uproar. The
      carved stags pushed out their heads, raised their antlers, and twisted
      their necks. The major-general sprung up in the air; and cried out to the
      old Chinaman, “They are running away! they are running away!” The two
      were rather frightened at this, so they jumped into the drawer of the
      window-seat. Here were three or four packs of cards not quite complete,
      and a doll’s theatre, which had been built up very neatly. A comedy was
      being performed in it, and all the queens of diamonds, clubs, and
      hearts,, and spades, sat in the first row fanning themselves with tulips,
      and behind them stood all the knaves, showing that they had heads above
      and below as playing cards generally have. The play was about two lovers,
      who were not allowed to marry, and the shepherdess wept because it was so
      like her own story. “I cannot bear it,” said she, “I must get out of the
      drawer;” but when they reached the floor, and cast their eyes on the
      table, there was the old Chinaman awake and shaking his whole body, till
      all at once down he came on the floor, “plump.” “The old Chinaman is
      coming,” cried the little shepherdess in a fright, and down she fell on
      one knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have thought of something,” said the chimney-sweep; “let us get into
      the great pot-pourri jar which stands in the corner; there we can lie on
      rose-leaves and lavender, and throw salt in his eyes if he comes near
      us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, that will never do,” said she, “because I know that the Chinaman and
      the pot-pourri jar were lovers once, and there always remains behind a
      feeling of good-will between those who have been so intimate as that. No,
      there is nothing left for us but to go out into the wide world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you really courage enough to go out into the wide world with me?”
      said the chimney-sweep; “have you thought how large it is, and that we
      can never come back here again?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I have,” she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the chimney-sweep saw that she was quite firm, he said, “My way is
      through the stove and up the chimney. Have you courage to creep with me
      through the fire-box, and the iron pipe? When we get to the chimney I
      shall know how to manage very well. We shall soon climb too high for any
      one to reach us, and we shall come through a hole in the top out into the
      wide world.” So he led her to the door of the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks very dark,” said she; still she went in with him through the
      stove and through the pipe, where it was as dark as pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now we are in the chimney,” said he; “and look, there is a beautiful
      star shining above it.” It was a real star shining down upon them as if
      it would show them the way. So they clambered, and crept on, and a
      frightful steep place it was; but the chimney-sweep helped her and
      supported her, till they got higher and higher. He showed her the best
      places on which to set her little china foot, so at last they reached the
      top of the chimney, and sat themselves down, for they were very tired, as
      may be supposed. The sky, with all its stars, was over their heads, and
      below were the roofs of the town. They could see for a very long distance
      out into the wide world, and the poor little shepherdess leaned her head
      on her chimney-sweep’s shoulder, and wept till she washed the gilt off
      her sash; the world was so different to what she expected. “This is too
      much,” she said; “I cannot bear it, the world is too large. Oh, I wish I
      were safe back on the table. again, under the looking glass; I shall
      never be happy till I am safe back again. Now I have followed you out
      into the wide world, you will take me back, if you love me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the chimney-sweep tried to reason with her, and spoke of the old
      Chinaman, and of the Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat’s
      legs; but she sobbed so bitterly, and kissed her little chimney-sweep
      till he was obliged to do all she asked, foolish as it was. And so, with
      a great deal of trouble, they climbed down the chimney, and then crept
      through the pipe and stove, which were certainly not very pleasant
      places. Then they stood in the dark fire-box, and listened behind the
      door, to hear what was going on in the room. As it was all quiet, they
      peeped out. Alas! there lay the old Chinaman on the floor; he had fallen
      down from the table as he attempted to run after them, and was broken
      into three pieces; his back had separated entirely, and his head had
      rolled into a corner of the room. The major-general stood in his old
      place, and appeared lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is terrible,” said the little shepherdess. “My poor old grandfather
      is broken to pieces, and it is our fault. I shall never live after this;”
      and she wrung her little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He can be riveted,” said the chimney-sweep; “he can be riveted. Do not
      be so hasty. If they cement his back, and put a good rivet in it, he will
      be as good as new, and be able to say as many disagreeable things to us
      as ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think so?” said she; and then they climbed up to the table, and
      stood in their old places.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As we have done no good,” said the chimney-sweep, “we might as well have
      remained here, instead of taking so much trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish grandfather was riveted,” said the shepherdess. “Will it cost
      much, I wonder?”
    </p>
    <p>
      And she had her wish. The family had the Chinaman’s back mended, and a
      strong rivet put through his neck; he looked as good as new, but he could
      no longer nod his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have become proud since your fall broke you to pieces,” said
      Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat’s-legs. “You have no
      reason to give yourself such airs. Am I to have her or not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The chimney-sweep and the little shepherdess looked piteously at the old
      Chinaman, for they were afraid he might nod; but he was not able:
      besides, it was so tiresome to be always telling strangers he had a rivet
      in the back of his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the little china people remained together, and were glad of the
      grandfather’s rivet, and continued to love each other till they were
      broken to pieces.
