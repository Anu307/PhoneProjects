<p>ne summer's morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the 
window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came 
a peasant woman down the street crying: 'Good jams, cheap! Good jams, 
cheap!' This rang pleasantly in the tailor's ears; he stretched his 
delicate head out of the window, and called: 'Come up here, dear woman; 
here you will get rid of your goods.' The woman came up the three steps 
to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots 
for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and 
at length said: 'The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four 
ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no 
consequence.' The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him 
what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. 'Now, this jam 
shall be blessed by God,' cried the little tailor, 'and give me health 
and strength'; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself 
a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. 'This won't 
taste bitter,' said he, 'but I will just finish the jacket before I 
take a bite.' He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made 
bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam 
rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were 
attracted and descended on it in hosts. 'Hi! who invited you?' said the 
little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however, 
who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back 
again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all 
patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, 
and saying: 'Wait, and I will give it to you,' struck it mercilessly on 
them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer 
than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. 'Are you a fellow of that 
sort?' said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. 'The whole 
town shall know of this!' And the little tailor hastened to cut himself 
a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: 'Seven at 
one stroke!' 'What, the town!' he continued, 'the whole world shall hear 
of it!' and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail. The tailor 
put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he 
thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away, 
he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could 
take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that 
he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which 
had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the 
cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, 
he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had 
reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking 
peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, 
and said: 'Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the 
wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck. 
Have you any inclination to go with me?' The giant looked contemptuously 
at the tailor, and said: 'You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!'

'Oh, indeed?' answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and 
showed the giant the girdle, 'there may you read what kind of a man I 
am!' The giant read: 'Seven at one stroke,' and thought that they had 
been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect 
for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took 
a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out 
of it. 'Do that likewise,' said the giant, 'if you have strength.' 'Is 
that all?' said the tailor, 'that is child's play with us!' and put his 
hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until 
the liquid ran out of it. 'Faith,' said he, 'that was a little better, 
wasn't it?' The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it 
of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high 
that the eye could scarcely follow it. 'Now, little mite of a man, do 
that likewise,' 'Well thrown,' said the tailor, 'but after all the stone 
came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come 
back at all,' and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, 
and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty, 
rose, flew away and did not come back. 'How does that shot please you, 
comrade?' asked the tailor. 'You can certainly throw,' said the giant, 
'but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.' He 
took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on 
the ground, and said: 'If you are strong enough, help me to carry the 
tree out of the forest.' 'Readily,' answered the little man; 'take you 
the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; 
after all, they are the heaviest.' The giant took the trunk on his 
shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who 
could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little 
tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and 
whistled the song: 'Three tailors rode forth from the gate,' as if 
carrying the tree were child's play. The giant, after he had dragged the 
heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: 'Hark 
you, I shall have to let the tree fall!' The tailor sprang nimbly down, 
seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said 
to the giant: 'You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry 
the tree!'

They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid 
hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it 
down, gave it into the tailor's hand, and bade him eat. But the little 
tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, 
it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. 
When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: 'What is 
this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?' 'There is no 
lack of strength,' answered the little tailor. 'Do you think that could 
be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over 
the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. 
Jump as I did, if you can do it.' The giant made the attempt but he 
could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so 
that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand. 
</p>
<p>The giant said: 'If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our 
cavern and spend the night with us.' The little tailor was willing, and 
followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting 
there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and 
was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: 'It is much 
more spacious here than in my workshop.' The giant showed him a bed, and 
said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too 
big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into 
a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little 
tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, 
cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the 
grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the 
forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he 
walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified, 
they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a 
great hurry. 
</p>
<p>The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose. 
After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal 
palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. 
Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and 
read on his girdle: 'Seven at one stroke.' 'Ah!' said they, 'what does 
the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty 
lord.' They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their 
opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful 
man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased 
the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer 
him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by 
the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, 
and then conveyed to him this proposal. 'For this very reason have 
I come here,' the tailor replied, 'I am ready to enter the king's 
service.' He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling 
was assigned him. 
</p>
<p>The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished 
him a thousand miles away. 'What is to be the end of this?' they said 
among themselves. 'If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, 
seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against 
him.' They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to 
the king, and begged for their dismissal. 'We are not prepared,' said 
they, 'to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.' The king was 
sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, 
wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly 
have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his 
dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people 
dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a 
long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor 
and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one 
request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants, 
who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, 
and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in 
danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he 
would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a 
dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him. 
'That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!' thought the 
little tailor. 'One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a 
kingdom every day of one's life!' 'Oh, yes,' he replied, 'I will soon 
subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen 
to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of 
two.' 
</p>
<p>The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him. 
When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: 
'Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.' Then 
he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a 
while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and 
snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not 
idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the 
tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat 
just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on 
the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing, 
but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: 'Why are you 
knocking me?' 'You must be dreaming,' said the other, 'I am not knocking 
you.' They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor 
threw a stone down on the second. 'What is the meaning of this?' cried 
the other 'Why are you pelting me?' 'I am not pelting you,' answered 
the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were 
weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The 
little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and 
threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. 'That 
is too bad!' cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his 
companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in 
the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and 
belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on 
the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. 'It is 
a lucky thing,' said he, 'that they did not tear up the tree on which 
I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a 
squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.' He drew out his sword and gave 
each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the 
horsemen and said: 'The work is done; I have finished both of them 
off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and 
defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man 
like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.' 'But are you not 
wounded?' asked the horsemen. 'You need not concern yourself about 
that,' answered the tailor, 'they have not bent one hair of mine.' The 
horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they 
found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the 
torn-up trees. 
</p>
<p>The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however, 
repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get 
rid of the hero. 'Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my 
kingdom,' said he to him, 'you must perform one more heroic deed. In 
the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch 
it first.' 'I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one 
blow, is my kind of affair.' He took a rope and an axe with him, went 
forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to 
wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards 
him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its 
horn without more ado. 'Softly, softly; it can't be done as quickly as 
that,' said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite 
close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against 
the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk 
that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it 
was caught. 'Now, I have got the bird,' said the tailor, and came out 
from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his 
axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the 
beast away and took it to the king. 
</p>
<p>The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third 
demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that 
made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their 
help. 'Willingly,' said the tailor, 'that is child's play!' He did not 
take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased 
that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in 
such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When 
the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and 
whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero 
fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at 
once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor 
ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging 
beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, 
was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they 
might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to 
the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his 
promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known 
that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before 
him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding 
was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a 
king was made. 
</p>
<p>After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at 
night: 'Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I 
will rap the yard-measure over your ears.' Then she discovered in what 
state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained 
of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of 
her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her 
and said: 'Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants 
shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind 
him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide 
world.' The woman was satisfied with this; but the king's armour-bearer, 
who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of 
the whole plot. 'I'll put a screw into that business,' said the little 
tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and 
when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, 
and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to 
be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: 'Boy, make me the doublet 
and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your 
ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one 
unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing 
outside the room.' When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they 
were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were 
behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against 
him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his 
life.
