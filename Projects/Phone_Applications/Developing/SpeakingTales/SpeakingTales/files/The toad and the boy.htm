<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The
toad and the boy</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The water-fowls were flying over the marshy
lakes. It was now the hunting season. Indian men, with bows and arrows, were
wading waist deep amid the wild rice. Near by, within their wigwams, the wives
were roasting wild duck and making down pillows. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the largest teepee sat a young mother
wrapping red porcupine quills about the long fringes of a buckskin cushion.
Beside her lay a black-eyed baby boy cooing and laughing. Reaching and kicking
upward with his tiny hands and feet, he played with the dangling strings of his
heavy-beaded bonnet hanging empty on a tent pole above him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length the mother laid aside her red quills
and white sinew-threads. The babe fell fast asleep. Leaning on one hand and
softly whispering a little lullaby, she threw a light cover over her baby. It
was almost time for the return of her husband. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Remembering there were no willow sticks for the
fire, she quickly girdled her blanket tight about her waist, and with a
short-handled ax slipped through her belt, she hurried away toward the wooded ravine.
She was strong and swung an ax as skillfully as any man. Her loose buckskin
dress was made for such freedom. Soon carrying easily a bundle of long willows
on her back, with a loop of rope over both her shoulders, she came striding
homeward. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Near the entrance way she stooped low, at once
shifting the bundle to the right and with both hands lifting the noose from
over her head. Having thus dropped the wood to the ground, she disappeared into
her teepee. In a moment she came running out again, crying, &quot;My son! My
little son is gone!&quot; Her keen eyes swept east and west and all around her.
There was nowhere any sign of the child. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Running with clinched fists to the nearest
teepees, she called: &quot;Has any one seen my baby? He is gone! My little son
is gone!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hinnu! Hinnu!&quot; exclaimed the women,
rising to their feet and rushing out of their wigwams. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We have not seen your child! What has
happened?&quot; queried the women. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With great tears in her eyes the mother told her
story. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We will search with you,&quot; they said
to her as she started off. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They met the returning husbands, who turned
about and joined in the hunt for the missing child. Along the shore of the
lakes, among the high-grown reeds, they looked in vain. He was nowhere to be
found. After many days and nights the search was given up. It was sad, indeed,
to hear the mother wailing aloud for her little son. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was growing late in the autumn. The birds
were flying high toward the south. The teepees around the lakes were gone, save
one lonely dwelling. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Till the winter snow covered the ground and ice
covered the lakes, the wailing woman's voice was heard from that solitary
wigwam. From some far distance was also the sound of the father's voice singing
a sad song. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus ten summers and as many winters have come
and gone since the strange disappearance of the little child. Every autumn with
the hunters came the unhappy parents of the lost baby to search again for him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Toward the latter part of the tenth season when,
one by one, the teepees were folded and the families went away from the lake
region, the mother walked again along the lake shore weeping. One evening,
across the lake from where the crying woman stood, a pair of bright black eyes
peered at her through the tall reeds and wild rice. A little wild boy stopped
his play among the tall grasses. His long, loose hair hanging down his brown
back and shoulders was carelessly tossed from his round face. He wore a loin
cloth of woven sweet grass. Crouching low to the marshy ground, he listened to
the wailing voice. As the voice grew hoarse and only sobs shook the slender
figure of the woman, the eyes of the wild boy grew dim and wet. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length, when the moaning ceased, he sprang to
his feet and ran like a nymph with swift outstretched toes. He rushed into a
small hut of reeds and grasses. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Mother! Mother! Tell me what voice it was
I heard which pleased my ears, but made my eyes grow wet!&quot; said he,
breathless. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Han, my son,&quot; grunted a big, ugly
toad. &quot;It was the voice of a weeping woman you heard. My son, do not say
you like it. Do not tell me it brought tears to your eyes. You have never heard
me weep. I can please your ear and break your heart. Listen!&quot; replied the
great old toad. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Stepping outside, she stood by the entrance way.
She was old and badly puffed out. She had reared a large family of little
toads, but none of them had aroused her love, nor ever grieved her. She had
heard the wailing human voice and marveled at the throat which produced the
strange sound. Now, in her great desire to keep the stolen boy awhile longer,
she ventured to cry as the Dakota woman does. In a gruff, coarse voice she
broke forth: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hin-hin, doe-skin! Hin-hin, Ermine,
Ermine! Hin-hin, red blanket, with white border!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Not knowing that the syllables of a Dakota's cry
are the names of loved ones gone, the ugly toad mother sought to please the
boy's ear with the names of valuable articles. Having shrieked in a torturing
voice and mouthed extravagant names, the old toad rolled her tearless eyes with
great satisfaction. Hopping back into her dwelling, she asked: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My son, did my voice bring tears to your
eyes? Did my words bring gladness to your ears? Do you not like my wailing
better?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, no!&quot; pouted the boy with some
impatience. &quot;I want to hear the woman's voice! Tell me, mother, why the
human voice stirs all my feelings!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The toad mother said within her breast,
&quot;The human child has heard and seen his real mother. I cannot keep him
longer, I fear. Oh, no, I cannot give away the pretty creature I have taught to
call me 'mother' all these many winters.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Mother,&quot; went on the child voice,
&quot;tell me one thing. Tell me why my little brothers and sisters are all
unlike me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The big, ugly toad, looking at her pudgy
children, said: &quot;The eldest is always best.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This reply quieted the boy for a while. Very
closely watched the old toad mother her stolen human son. When by chance he
started off alone, she shoved out one of her own children after him, saying:
&quot;Do not come back without your big brother.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus the wild boy with the long, loose hair sits
every day on a marshy island hid among the tall reeds. But he is not alone.
Always at his feet hops a little toad brother. One day an Indian hunter, wading
in the deep waters, spied the boy. He had heard of the baby stolen long ago. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is he!&quot; murmured the hunter to
himself as he ran to his wigwam. &quot;I saw among the tall reeds a
black-haired boy at play!&quot; shouted he to the people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At once the unhappy father and mother cried out,
&quot;'Tis he, our boy!&quot; Quickly he led them to the lake. Peeping through
the wild rice, he pointed with unsteady finger toward the boy playing all
unawares. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;'Tis he! 'tis he!&quot; cried the mother,
for she knew him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In silence the hunter stood aside, while the
happy father and mother caressed their baby boy grown tall. </span></p>
