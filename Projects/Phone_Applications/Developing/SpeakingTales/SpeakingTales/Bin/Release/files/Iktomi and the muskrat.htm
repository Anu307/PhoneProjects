<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi
and the muskrat</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Beside a white lake, beneath a large grown
willow tree, sat Iktomi on the bare ground. The heap of smouldering ashes told
of a recent open fire. With ankles crossed together around a pot of soup,
Iktomi bent over some delicious boiled fish. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Fast he dipped his black horn spoon into the
soup, for he was ravenous. Iktomi had no regular meal times. Often when he was
hungry he went without food. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Well hid between the lake and the wild rice, he
looked nowhere save into the pot of fish. Not knowing when the next meal would
be, he meant to eat enough now to last some time. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, how, my friend!&quot; said a voice
out of the wild rice. Iktomi started. He almost choked with his soup. He peered
through the long reeds from where he sat with his long horn spoon in mid-air. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, my friend!&quot; said the voice
again, this time close at his side. Iktomi turned and there stood a dripping
muskrat who had just come out of the lake. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, it is my friend who startled me. I
wondered if among the wild rice some spirit voice was talking. How, how, my
friend!&quot; said Iktomi. The muskrat stood smiling. On his lips hung a ready
&quot;Yes, my friend,&quot; when Iktomi would ask, &quot;My friend, will you
sit down beside me and share my food?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That was the custom of the plains people. Yet
Iktomi sat silent. He hummed an old dance-song and beat gently on the edge of
the pot with his buffalo-horn spoon. The muskrat began to feel awkward before
such lack of hospitality and wished himself under water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After many heart throbs Iktomi stopped drumming
with his horn ladle, and looking upward into the muskrat's face, he said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friend, let us run a race to see who
shall win this pot of fish. If I win, I shall not need to share it with you. If
you win, you shall have half of it.&quot; Springing to his feet, Iktomi began
at once to tighten the belt about his waist. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friend Ikto, I cannot run a race with
you! I am not a swift runner, and you are nimble as a deer. We shall not run
any race together,&quot; answered the hungry muskrat. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>For a moment Iktomi stood with a hand on his
long protruding chin. His eyes were fixed upon something in the air. The
muskrat looked out of the corners of his eyes without moving his head. He
watched the wily Iktomi concocting a plot. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Iktomi, suddenly
turning his gaze upon the unwelcome visitor; &quot;I shall carry a large stone
on my back. That will slacken my usual speed; and the race will be a fair
one.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Saying this he laid a firm hand upon the
muskrat's shoulder and started off along the edge of the lake. When they
reached the opposite side Iktomi pried about in search of a heavy stone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He found one half-buried in the shallow water.
Pulling it out upon dry land, he wrapped it in his blanket. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, my friend, you shall run on the left
side of the lake, I on the other. The race is for the boiled fish in yonder
kettle!&quot; said Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The muskrat helped to lift the heavy stone upon
Iktomi's back. Then they parted. Each took a narrow path through the tall reeds
fringing the shore. Iktomi found his load a heavy one. Perspiration hung like
beads on his brow. His chest heaved hard and fast. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He looked across the lake to see how far the
muskrat had gone, but nowhere did he see any sign of him. &quot;Well, he is
running low under the wild rice!&quot; said he. Yet as he scanned the tall
grasses on the lake shore, he saw not one stir as if to make way for the
runner. &quot;Ah, has he gone so fast ahead that the disturbed grasses in his trail
have quieted again?&quot; exclaimed Iktomi. With that thought he quickly
dropped the heavy stone. &quot;No more of this!&quot; said he, patting his
chest with both hands. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Off with a springing bound, he ran swiftly
toward the goal. Tufts of reeds and grass fell flat under his feet. Hardly had
they raised their heads when Iktomi was many paces gone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon he reached the heap of cold ashes. Iktomi
halted stiff as if he had struck an invisible cliff. His black eyes showed a
ring of white about them as he stared at the empty ground. There was no pot of
boiled fish! There was no water-man in sight! &quot;Oh, if only I had shared my
food like a real Dakota, I would not have lost it all! Why did I not know the
muskrat would run through the water? He swims faster than I could ever run!
That is what he has done. He has laughed at me for carrying a weight on my back
while he shot hither like an arrow!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Crying thus to himself, Iktomi stepped to the
water's brink. He stooped forward with a hand on each bent knee and peeped far
into the deep water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;There!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I see
you, my friend, sitting with your ankles wound around my little pot of fish! My
friend, I am hungry. Give me a bone!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ha! ha! ha!&quot; laughed the water-man,
the muskrat. The sound did not rise up out of the lake, for it came down from
overhead. With his hands still on his knees, Iktomi turned his face upward into
the great willow tree. Opening wide his mouth he begged, &quot;My friend, my
friend, give me a bone to gnaw!&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; laughed the muskrat, and leaning over
the limb he sat upon, he let fall a small sharp bone which dropped right into
Iktomi's throat. Iktomi almost choked to death before he could get it out. In
the tree the muskrat sat laughing loud. &quot;Next time, say to a visiting
friend, 'Be seated beside me, my friend. Let me share with you my food.'&quot;</span></p>
