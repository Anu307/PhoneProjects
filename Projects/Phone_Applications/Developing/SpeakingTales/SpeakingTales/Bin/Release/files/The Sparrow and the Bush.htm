sparrow once flew down upon a bush and said, “Little bush, give good little
sparrow a swing.”––“I won’t!” said the little bush. Then the sparrow was angry,
and went to the goat and said, “Goat, goat, nibble bush, bush won’t give good
little sparrow a swing.”––“I won’t!” said the goat.––Then the sparrow went to
the wolf and said, “Wolf, wolf, eat goat, goat won’t nibble bush, bush won’t
give good little sparrow a swing.”––“I won’t!” said the wolf.––Then the sparrow
went to the people and said, “Good people, kill wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat
won’t nibble bush, bush won’t give good little sparrow a swing.”––“We won’t!”
said the people.––Then the sparrow went to the Tartars and said, “Tartars,
Tartars, slay people, people won’t kill wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t
nibble bush, bush won’t give good little sparrow a swing.”––But the Tartars
said, “We won’t slay the people!” and the people said, “We won’t kill the
wolf!” and the wolf said, “I won’t eat the goat!” and the goat said, “I won’t
nibble the bush!” and the bush said, “I won’t give the good little sparrow a
swing.”––“Go!” said the bush, “to the fire, for the Tartars won’t slay the
people, and the people won’t kill the wolf, and the wolf won’t eat the goat,
and the goat won’t nibble the bush, and the bush won’t give the dear little
sparrow a swing.”––But the fire also said, “I won’t!” (they were all
alike)––“go to the water,” said he.––So the sparrow went to the water and said,
“Come water, quench fire, fire won’t burn Tartars, Tartars won’t slay people,
people won’t kill wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t nibble bush, bush won’t
give good little sparrow a swing.”––But the water also said, “I won’t!” So the
sparrow went to the ox and said, “Ox, ox, drink water, water won’t quench fire,
fire won’t burn Tartars, Tartars won’t slay people, people won’t kill wolf,
wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t nibble bush, bush won’t give little sparrow a
swing.”––“I won’t!” said the ox.––Then the sparrow went to the pole-axe and
said, “Pole-axe, pole-axe, strike ox, ox won’t drink water, water won’t quench
fire, fire won’t burn Tartars, Tartars won’t slay people, people won’t kill
wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t nibble bush, bush won’t give little
sparrow a swing.”––“I won’t!” said the pole-axe.––So the sparrow went to the
worms and said, “Worms, worms, gnaw pole-axe, pole-axe won’t strike ox, ox
won’t drink water, water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn Tartars, Tartars
won’t slay people, people won’t kill wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t
nibble bush, bush won’t give little sparrow a swing.”––“We won’t!” said the
worms.––Then the sparrow went to the hen and said, “Hen, hen, peck worms, worms
won’t gnaw pole-axe, pole-axe won’t strike ox, ox won’t drink water, water
won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn Tartars, Tartars won’t slay people, people
won’t kill wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t nibble bush, bush won’t give
little sparrow a swing.”––“I won’t!” said the hen, “but go to the sparrow-hawk,
he ought to give the first push, or why is he called the Pusher!”––So the
sparrow went to the sparrow-hawk and said, “Come, pusher, seize hen, hen won’t
peck worms, worms won’t gnaw pole-axe, pole-axe won’t strike ox, ox won’t drink
water, water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn Tartars, Tartars won’t slay
people, people won’t kill wolf, wolf won’t eat goat, goat won’t nibble bush,
bush won’t give little sparrow a swing.”</span></p>
