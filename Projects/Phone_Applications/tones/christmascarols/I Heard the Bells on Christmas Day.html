<H2>I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day</H2>
<P><B>I</B> heard the bells on Christmas Day <BR>Their old familiar carols play. <BR>And wild and sweet the words repeat <BR>Of Peace on earth, good will to men. 
<P><B>I</B> thought how as the day had come <BR>The belfries of all Christendom <BR>Had roll'd along th' unbroken song <BR>Of Peace on earth, good will to men. 
<P><B>A</B>nd in despair, I bow'd my head: <BR>"There is no peace on earth," I said, <BR>"For hate is strong and mocks the song, <BR>Of Peace on earth, good will to men." 
<P><B>T</B>hen pealed the bells more loud and deep; <BR>"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; <BR>The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, <BR>With Peace on earth, good will to men." <BR>
