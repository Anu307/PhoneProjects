<H2>It Came Upon A Midnight Clear</H2>
<P><B>I</B>t came upon the midnight clear, <BR>That glorious song of old, <BR>From angels bending near the earth, <BR>To touch their harps of gold! <BR>"Peace on the earth, good will to men, <BR>From heaven's all gracious King! <BR>The world in solemn stillness lay, <BR>To hear the angels sing. 
<P><I>S</I>till through the cloven skies they come, <BR>With peaceful wings unfurled, <BR>And still their heavenly music floats, <BR>O'er all the weary world; <BR>Above its sad and lowly plains, <BR>They bend on hovering wing. <BR>And ever o'er its Babel sounds, <BR>The blessed angels sing. 
<P><I>Y</I>et with the woes of sin and strife, <BR>The world hath suffered long; <BR>Beneath the angel-strain have rolled, <BR>Two thousand years of wrong; <BR>And man, at war with man, hears not, <BR>The love song which they bring: <BR>O hush the noise, ye men of strife, <BR>And hear the angels sing. 
<P><I>F</I>or lo! the days are hastening on, <BR>By prophet bards foretold, <BR>When, with the ever-circling years, <BR>Shall come the Age of Gold; <BR>When peace shall over all the earth, <BR>Its ancient splendors fling, <BR>And all the world give back the song, <BR>Which now the angels sing. <BR>
