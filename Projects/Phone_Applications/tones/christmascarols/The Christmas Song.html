<H2>The Christmas Song</H2>
<P><B>C</B>hestnuts roasting on an open fire, <BR>Jack Frost nipping on your nose, <BR>Yuletide carols being sung by a choir, <BR>And folks dressed up like Eskimos. 
<P><B>E</B>verybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, <BR>Help to make the season bright. <BR>Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, <BR>Will find it hard to sleep tonight. 
<P><B>T</B>hey know that Santa's on his way; <BR>He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. <BR>And every mother's child is going to spy, <BR>To see if reindeer really know how to fly. 
<P><B>A</B>nd so I'm offering this simple phrase, <BR>To kids from one to ninety-two, <BR>Although its been said many times, many ways, <BR>A very Merry Christmas to you! <BR>
