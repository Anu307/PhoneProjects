<H2>Angels, From the Realms of Glory</H2>
<P><B>A</B>ngels, from the realms of glory, <BR>Wing your flight o'er all the earth; <BR>Ye, who sang creation's story, <BR>Now proclaim Messiah's birth: <BR><I>Come and worship,</I> <BR><I>Come and worship,</I> <BR><I>Worship Christ, the new-born King.</I> 
<P><B>S</B>hepherds in the field abiding, <BR>Watching o'er your flocks by night, <BR>God with man is now residing; <BR>Yonder shines the infant Light: <I>Refrain</I> 
<P><B>S</B>ages, leave your contemplations, <BR>Brighter visions beam afar: <BR>Seek the great Desire of nations; <BR>Ye have seen his natal star: <I>Refrain</I> 
<P><B>S</B>aints before the altar bending, <BR>Watching long in hope and fear, <BR>Suddenly the Lord, descending, <BR>In his temple shall appear: <I>Refrain</I> <BR>
<P>
