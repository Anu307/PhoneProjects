<H2>We Three Kings of Orient Are</H2>
<P><B>W</B>e three kings of Orient are <BR>Bearing gifts we traverse afar. <BR>Field and fountain, moor and mountain, <BR>Following yonder star. 
<P><B><I>Chorus</I></B> <BR><I>O star of wonder, star of night,</I> <BR><I>Star with royal beauty bright,</I> <BR><I>Westward leading, still proceeding,</I> <BR><I>Guide us to thy perfect Light.</I> 
<P><B>B</B>orn a king on Bethlehem's plain, <BR>Gold I bring to crown Him again, <BR>King forever, ceasing never <BR>Over us all to reign. <I>Chorus</I> 
<P><B>F</B>rankincense to offer have I. <BR>Incense owns a Deity nigh. <BR>Prayer and praising all men raising, <BR>Worship Him, God on high. <I>Chorus</I> 
<P><B>M</B>yrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume <BR>Breaths a life of gathering gloom. <BR>Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying, <BR>Sealed in the stone-cold tomb. <I>Chorus</I> 
<P><B>G</B>lorious now behold Him arise, <BR>King and God and Sacrifice. <BR>Alleluia, alleluia! <BR>Sounds through the earth and skies. <I>Chorus</I> <BR>
