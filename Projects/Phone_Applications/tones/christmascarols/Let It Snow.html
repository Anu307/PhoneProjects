<H2>Let It Snow</H2>
<P><B>O</B>h the weather outside is frightful, <BR>But the fire is so delightful, <BR>And since we've no place to go, <BR>Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
<P><B>I</B>t doesn't show signs of stopping, <BR>And I've bought some corn for popping, <BR>The lights are turned way down low, <BR>Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
<P><B>W</B>hen we finally kiss goodnight, <BR>How I'll hate going out in the storm! <BR>But if you'll really hold me tight, <BR>All the way home I'll be warm. 
<P><B>T</B>he fire is slowly dying, <BR>And, my dear, we're still good-bying, <BR>But as long as you love me so, <BR>Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
