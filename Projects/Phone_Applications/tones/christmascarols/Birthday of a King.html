<H2>Birthday of a King</H2>
<P><B>I</B>n the little village of Bethlehem <BR>There lay a child one day <BR>And the sky was bright <BR>With a holy light <BR>O'er the place where Jesus lay. 
<P><B>A</B>lleluia <BR>O how the angels sang! <BR>Alleluia <BR>How it rang! <BR>And the sky was bright <BR>With a holy light <BR>'Twas the birthday of a King. 
<P><B>H</B>umble birthplace <BR>But O <BR>How much God gave to us that day! <BR>From the manger bed what a path has led <BR>What a perfect holy way. 
<P><B>A</B>lleluia <BR>O how the angels sang! <BR>Alleluia <BR>How it rang! <BR>And the sky was bright <BR>With a Holy light <BR>'Twas the birthday of a King. <!-- <p>&nbsp;<br><font size="2"><i>Lyrics by Sammy Cahn</i></font>
