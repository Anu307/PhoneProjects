Star of the East, oh Bethlehem star, 
Guiding us on to heaven afar 
Sorrow and grief and lull'd by the light 
Thou hope of each mortal, in death's lonely night 
Fearless and tranquil, we look up to Thee 
Knowing thou be m'st through eternity 
Help us to follow where Thou still dost guide 
Pilgrims of earth so wise 
Chorus 
Star of the East, thou hope of the soul 
While round us here the dark billows roll 
Lead us from sin to glory afar 
Thou star of the East, thou sweet Bethlehem's star 
Star of the East, oh Bethlehem's star, 
What tho' the storms of riat gather loud 
Faithful and pure thy rays beam to save 
And bright o'er the grave 
Smile of a Saviour are mirror'd in Thee 
Glimpses of Heav'n in thy light we see 
Guide us still onward to that blessed shore 
After earth toil is o'er 
Star of the East, thou hope of the soul 
Oh star that leads to God above 
Whose rays are peace and joy and love 
Watch o'er us still till life hath ceased 
Beam on, bright star, sweet Bethlehem star
