Hark! the herald angels sing 
Glory to the new-born King! 
Peace on earth and mercy mild, 
God and sinners reconciled! 
Joyful, all ye nations, rise, 
Join the triumph of the skies; 
With th' angelic host proclaim 
Christ is born in Bethlehem! 
Hark! the herald angels sing 
Glory to the new-born King! 
Christ, by highest heaven adored; 
Christ, the everlasting Lord; 
Late in time behold him come, 
Offspring of the Virgin's womb. 
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; 
Hail the incarnate Deity, 
Pleased as man with man to dwell; 
Jesus, our Emmanuel! Refrain 
Mild he lays his glory by, 
Born that man no more may die, 
Born to raise the sons of earth, 
Born to give them second birth. 
Risen with healing in his wings, 
Light and life to all he brings, 
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness! 
Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace! Refrain 
Come, Desire of nations come, 
Fix in us Thy humble home; 
Rise, the Woman's conquering Seed, 
Bruise in us the Serpent's head. 
Adam's likeness now efface: 
Stamp Thine image in its place; 
Second Adam, from above, 
Reinstate us in thy love. Refrain
