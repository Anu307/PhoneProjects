O come, all ye faithful, 
Joyful and triumphant, 
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; 
Come and behold him, 
Born the King of angels; 
O come, let us adore him, 
O come, let us adore him, 
O Come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord. 
God of God, 
Light of Light, 
Lo! he abhors not the Virgin's womb: 
Very God, 
Begotten, not created; Refrain 
Sing, choirs of angels, 
Sing in exultation, 
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above; 
Glory to God 
In the highest; Refrain 
See how the shepherds, 
Summoned to his cradle, 
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze; 
We too will thither 
Bend our joyful footsteps; Refrain 
Child, for us sinners 
Poor and in the manger, 
We would embrace thee, with love and awe; 
Who would not live thee, 
Loving us so dearly? Refrain 
Yea, Lord, we greet thee, 
Born this happy morning; 
Jesus, to thee be glory given; 
Word of the Father, 
Now in flesh appearing; Refrain
