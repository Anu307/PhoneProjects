A ray of hope flickers in the sky 
A tiny star lights up way up high 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn 
This comes to pass when a child is born 
A silent wish sails the seven seas 
The winds of change whisper in the trees 
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn 
This comes to pass, when a child is born 
A rosy hue settles all around 
You got the feel, you're on solid ground 
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn 
This comes to pass, when a child is born 
Spoken: And all of this happens, because the world is waiting. 
Waiting for one child; Black-white-yellow, no one knows... 
but a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter, 
hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor, 
and misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten forever. 
It's all a dream and illusion now, 
It must come true sometime soon somehow, 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn, 
This comes to pass when a child is born.
