Happy Holiday 
Happy Holiday 
While the merry bells keep ringing 
May your every wish come true 
Happy Holiday 
Happy Holiday 
May the calendar keep bringing 
Happy Holidays to you 
It's the holiday season 
And Santa Claus is coming back 
The Christmas snow is white on the ground 
When old Santa gets into town 
He'll be coming down the chimney, down 
Coming down the chimney, down 
It's the holiday season 
And Santa Claus has got a toy 
For every good girl and good little boy 
He's a great big bundle of joy 
He'll be coming down the chimney, down 
Coming down the chimney, down 
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back 
And lots of goodies for you and me 
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick 
Hanging on the Christmas tree 
It's the holiday season 
With the whoop-de-do and hickory dock 
And don't forget to hang up your sock 
"Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock 
He'll be coming down the chimney 
Coming down the chimney 
Coming down the chimney, down! 
Happy Holiday 
Happy Holiday 
While the merry bells keep bringing 
Happy Holidays to you 
Happy Holiday 
Happy Holiday 
May the calendar keep bringing 
Happy Holidays to you 
To you 
Happy Holiday
