Everybody likes to take a holiday 
Everybody likes to take a rest 
Spending time together with the family 
Sharing lots of love and happiness. 
Come on, ring those bells, 
Light the Christmas tree, 
Jesus is the king 
Born for you and me. 
Come on, ring those bells, 
Every-body say, 
Jesus, we remember 
This your birthday. 
Celebrations come because of something good. 
Celebrations we love to recall 
Mary had a baby boy in Bethleham 
the greatest celebration of all. 
Come on, ring those bells, 
Light the Christmas tree, 
Jesus is the King 
Born for you and me. 
Come on, ring those bells, 
Every-body say, 
Jesus, we remember 
This your birthday.
