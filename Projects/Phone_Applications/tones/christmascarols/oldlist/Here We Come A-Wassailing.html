Here we come a-wassailing 
Among the leaves so green, 
Here we come a-wand'ring 
So fair to be seen. 
Love and joy come to you, 
And to you your wassail, too, 
And God bless you, and send you 
A Happy New Year, 
And God send you a Happy New Year. 
We are not daily beggers 
That beg from door to door, 
But we are neighbors' children 
Whom you have seen before 
Love and joy come to you, 
And to you your wassail, too, 
And God bless you, and send you 
A Happy New Year, 
And God send you a Happy New Year. 
Good master and good mistress, 
As you sit beside the fire, 
Pray think of us poor children 
Who wander in the mire. 
Love and joy come to you, 
And to you your wassail, too, 
And God bless you, and send you 
A Happy New Year, 
And God send you a Happy New Year. 
We have a little purse 
Made of ratching leather skin; 
We want some of your small change 
To line it well within. 
Love and joy come to you, 
And to you your wassail, too, 
And God bless you, and send you 
A Happy New Year, 
And God send you a Happy New Year. 
Bring us out a table 
And spread it with a cloth; 
Bring us out a cheese, 
And of your Christmas loaf. 
Love and joy come to you, 
And to you your wassail, too, 
And God bless you, and send you 
A Happy New Year, 
And God send you a Happy New Year. 
God bless the master of this house, 
Likewise the mistress too; 
And all the little children 
That round the table go. 
Love and joy come to you, 
And to you your wassail, too, 
And God bless you, and send you 
A Happy New Year, 
And God send you a Happy New Year.
