Jesus, our brother, kind and good, 
Was humbly born in a stable rude; 
And the friendly beasts around Him stood. 
Jesus, our brother, kind and good. 
"I," said the Donkey, shaggy and brown, 
"I carried His mother up hill and down; 
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town." 
"I," said the Donkey, shaggy and brown. 
"I," said the Cow, all white and red, 
"I gave Him my manger for His bed; 
I gave Him my hay to pillow His head." 
"I," said the Cow, all white and red. 
"I," said the Sheep, with the curly horn, 
"I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm; 
He wore my coat on Christmas morn." 
"I," said the Sheep, with the curly horn. 
"I," said the Dove, from the rafters high, 
"I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry; 
We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I." 
"I," said the Dove, from the rafters high. 
Thus every beast by some glad spell, 
In the stable dark was glad to tell 
Of the gift he gave Emmanuel, 
The gift he gave Emmanuel.
