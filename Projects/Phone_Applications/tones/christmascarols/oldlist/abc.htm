<br><h2>Winter Wonderland</h2>



<p><b>S</b>leigh bells ring, are you listening,
<br>In the lane, snow is glistening
<br>A beautiful sight,
<br>We're happy tonight.
<br>Walking in a winter wonderland.

<p><b>G</b>one away is the bluebird,
<br>Here to stay is a new bird
<br>He sings a love song,
<br>As we go along,
<br>Walking in a winter wonderland. 

<p><b>I</b>n the meadow we can build a snowman,
<br>Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 

<p><b>H</b>e'll say: Are you married?
<br>We'll say: No man,
<br>But you can do the job
<br>When you're in town. 

<p><b>L</b>ater on, we'll conspire,
<br>As we dream by the fire
<br>To face unafraid,
<br>The plans that we've made,
<br>Walking in a winter wonderland. 

<p><b>I</b>n the meadow we can build a snowman,
<br>And pretend that he's a circus clown
<br>We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
<br>Until the other kiddies knock him down. 

<p><b>W</b>hen it snows, ain't it thrilling,
<br>Though your nose gets a chilling
<br>We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
<br>Walking in a winter wonderland. 

<p><b>W</b>alking in a winter wonderland,
<br>Walking in a winter wonderland.
