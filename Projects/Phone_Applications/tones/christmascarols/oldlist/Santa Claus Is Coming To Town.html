Oh! You better watch out, 
You better not cry, 
You better not pout, 
I'm telling you why: 
Santa Claus is coming to town! 
He's making a list, 
He's checking it twice, 
He's gonna find out 
who's naughty or nice. 
Santa Claus is coming to town! 
He sees you when you're sleeping, 
He knows when you're awake. 
He knows when you've been bad or good, 
So be good for goodness sake! 
So...You better watch out, 
You better not cry 
You better not pout, 
I'm telling you why. 
Santa Claus is coming to town. 
Little tin horns, 
Little toy drums. 
Rudy-toot-toot 
and rummy tum tums. 
Santa Claus is coming to town. 
Little toy dolls 
that cuddle and coo, 
Elephants, boats 
and Kiddie cars too. 
Santa Claus is coming to town. 
The kids in Girl and Boy Land 
will have a jubilee. 
They're gonna build a toyland town 
all around the Christmas tree. 
Oh....You better watch out, 
You better not cry. 
You better not pout, 
I'm telling you why. 
Santa Claus is comin' 
Santa Claus is comin' 
Santa Claus is comin' 
To town.
