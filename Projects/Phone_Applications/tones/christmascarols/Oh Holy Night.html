<H2>Oh Holy Night</H2>
<P><B>O</B>h holy night! <BR>The stars are brightly shining <BR>It is the night of the dear Savior's birth! <BR>Long lay the world in sin and error pining <BR>Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth. <BR>A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices <BR>For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn! <I>
<P><B>F</B>all on your knees <BR>Oh hear the angel voices <BR>Oh night divine <BR>Oh night when Christ was born <BR>Oh night divine <BR>Oh night divine</I> 
<P><B>L</B>ed by the light of Faith serenely beaming <BR>With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand <BR>So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming <BR>Here come the wise men from Orient land <BR>The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger <BR>In all our trials born to be our friend. 
<P><B>T</B>ruly He taught us to love one another <BR>His law is love and His gospel is peace <BR>Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother <BR>And in His name all oppression shall cease <BR>Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, <BR>Let all within us praise His holy name.
