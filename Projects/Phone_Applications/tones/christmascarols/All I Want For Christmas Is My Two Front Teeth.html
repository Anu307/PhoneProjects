<P><B>A</B>ll I want for Christmas <BR>is my two front teeth, <BR>my two front teeth, <BR>see my two front teeth!</I> 
<P><B>G</B>ee, if I could only <BR>have my two front teeth, <BR>then I could wish you <BR>"Merry Christmas." <BR>It seems so long since I could say, <BR>"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!" <BR>Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be, <BR>if I could only whistle (thhhh, thhhh) <I>
