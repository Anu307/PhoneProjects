<H2>Away in a Manger</H2>
<P><B>A</B>way in a manger, no crib for a bed, <BR>The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. <BR>The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay, <BR>The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. 
<P><B>T</B>he cattle are lowing, the baby awakes, <BR>But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes. <BR>I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky, <BR>And stay by my side until morning is nigh. 
<P><B>B</B>e near me Lord Jesus, <BR>I ask thee to stay. <BR>Close by me forever, <BR>And love my I pray. 
<P><B>B</B>less all the dear children, <BR>In thy tender care. <BR>And take them to heaven, <BR>To be with thee there. <BR>
<P>
