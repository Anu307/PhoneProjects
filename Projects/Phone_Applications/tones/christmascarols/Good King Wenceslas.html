<H2>Good King Wenceslas</H2>
<P><B>G</B>ood King Wenceslas looked out <BR>On the feast of Stephen, <BR>When the snow lay round about, <BR>Deep and crisp and even. <BR>Brightly shown the moon that night, <BR>Though the frost was cruel, <BR>When a poor man came in sight, <BR>Gathering winter fuel. 
<P><B>H</B>ither, page, and stand by me. <BR>If thou know it telling: <BR>Yonder peasant, who is he? <BR>Where and what his dwelling? <BR>Sire, he lives a good league hence, <BR>Underneath the mountain, <BR>Right against the forest fence <BR>By Saint Agnes fountain. 
<P><B>B</B>ring me flesh, and bring me wine. <BR>Bring me pine logs hither. <BR>Thou and I will see him dine <BR>When we bear the thither. <BR>Page and monarch, forth they went, <BR>Forth they went together <BR>Through the rude wind's wild lament <BR>And the bitter weather. 
<P><B>S</B>ire, the night is darker now, <BR>And the wind blows stronger. <BR>Fails my heart, I know not how. <BR>I can go no longer. <BR>Ark my footsteps my good page, <BR>Tread thou in them boldly: <BR>Thou shalt find the winter's rage <BR>Freeze thy blood less coldly. 
<P><B>I</B>n his master's step he trod, <BR>Where the snow lay dented. <BR>Heat was in the very sod <BR>Which the saint had printed. <BR>Therefore, Christian men, be sure, <BR>Wealth or rank possessing, <BR>Ye who now will bless the poor <BR>Shall yourselves find blessing. <BR>
