<H2>Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer</H2>
<P><B>G</B>randma got run over by a reindeer <BR>Walking home from our house Christmas eve. <BR>You can say there's no such thing as Santa, <BR>But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. <BR>She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog, <BR>And we'd begged her not to go. <BR>But she'd left her medication, <BR>So she stumbled out the door into the snow. <BR>When they found her Christmas mornin', <BR>At the scene of the attack. <BR>There were hoof prints on her forehead, <BR>And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back.

<P><B>N</B>ow were all so proud of Grandpa, <BR>He's been takin' this so well. <BR>See him in there watchin' football, <BR>Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle. <BR>It's not Christmas without Grandma. <BR>All the family's dressed in black. 
<P><B>A</B>nd we just can't help but wonder: <BR>Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

<P><B>N</B>ow the goose is on the table <BR>And the pudding made of fig. <BR>And a blue and silver candle, <BR>That would just have matched the hair in Grandma'swig. <BR>I've warned all my friends and neighbours. <BR>Better watch out for yourselves." <BR>They should never give a license, <BR>To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.
