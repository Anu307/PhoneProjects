[shaah-e-dii.ndaar=pious/religious king; shifaa=regain health after an illness] 

Note: This is a 'qataah' written by Ghalib after Bahadur Shah Zafar's son (Dara Shikoh I think but I am not sure) recovered from what many thought would be a fatal illness. The recovery of the prince is equated to the return of spring, and nature in all its beauty seems to be celebrating along with the rest of the world. Some say it was the emperor himself whose recovery prompted this qataah from Ghalib.

Ghalib is not known to be a 'nature' poet. This is one of the rare instances where he has used his poetic skills to descibe nature.
