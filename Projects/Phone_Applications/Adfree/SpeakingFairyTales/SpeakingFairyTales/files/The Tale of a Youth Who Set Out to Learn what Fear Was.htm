Tale of a Youth Who Set Out to Learn what Fear Was</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A father had two sons, of whom the eldest was
clever and bright, and always knew what he was about; but the youngest was
stupid, and couldn't learn or understand anything. So much so that those who
saw him exclaimed: &quot;What a burden he'll be to his father!&quot; Now when
there was anything to be done, the eldest had always to do it; but if something
was required later or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard
or some such ghostly place, he always replied: &quot;Oh! no, father: nothing
will induce me to go there, it makes me shudder!&quot; for he was afraid. Or,
when they sat of an evening around the fire telling stories which made one's
flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: &quot;Oh! it makes one
shudder,&quot; the youngest sat in a corner, heard the exclamation, and could
not understand what it meant. &quot;They are always saying it makes one
shudder! it makes one shudder! Nothing makes me shudder. It's probably an art
quite beyond me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now it happened that his father said to him one
day: &quot;Hearken, you there in the corner; you are growing big and strong,
and you must learn to earn your own bread. Look at your brother, what pains he
takes; but all the money I've spent on your education is thrown away.&quot;
&quot;My dear father,&quot; he replied, &quot;I will gladly learn--in fact, if
it were possible I should like to learn to shudder; I don't understand that a
bit yet.&quot; The eldest laughed when he heard this, and thought to himself:
&quot;Good heavens! what a ninny my brother is! he'll never come to any good;
as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.&quot; The father sighed, and
answered him: &quot;You'll soon learn to shudder; but that won't help you to
make a living.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Shortly after this, when the sexton came to pay
them a visit, the father broke out to him, and told him what a bad hand his
youngest son was at everything: he knew nothing and learned nothing. &quot;Only
think! when I asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood, he actually asked
to be taught to shudder.&quot; &quot;If that's all he wants,&quot; said the
sexton, &quot;I can teach him that; just you send him to me, I'll soon polish
him up.&quot; The father was quite pleased with the proposal, because he thought:
&quot;It will be a good discipline for the youth.&quot; And so the sexton took
him into his house, and his duty was to toll the bell. After a few days he woke
him at midnight, and bade him rise and climb into the tower and toll.
&quot;Now, my friend, I'll teach you to shudder,&quot; thought he. He stole
forth secretly in front, and when the youth was up above, and had turned round
to grasp the bell-rope, he saw, standing opposite the hole of the belfry, a
white figure. &quot;Who's there?&quot; he called out, but the figure gave no
answer, and neither stirred nor moved. &quot;Answer,&quot; cried the youth,
&quot;or begone; you have no business here at this hour of the night.&quot; But
the sexton remained motionless, so that the youth might think that it was a
ghost. The youth called out the second time: &quot;What do you want here? Speak
if you are an honest fellow, or I'll knock you down the stairs.&quot; The
sexton thought: &quot;He can't mean that in earnest,&quot; so gave forth no
sound, and stood as though he were made of stone. Then the youth shouted out to
him the third time, and as that too had no effect, he made a dash at the
spectre and knocked it down the stairs, so that it fell about ten steps and
remained lying in a corner. Thereupon he tolled the bell, went home to bed
without saying a word, and fell asleep. The sexton's wife waited a long time
for her husband, but he never appeared. At last she became anxious, and woke
the youth, and asked: &quot;Don't you know where my husband is? He went up to
the tower in front of you.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; answered the youth; &quot;but
someone stood on the stairs up there just opposite the trap-door in the belfry,
and because he wouldn't answer me, or go away, I took him for a rogue and
knocked him down. You'd better go and see if it was he; I should be much
distressed if it were.&quot; The wife ran and found her husband who was lying
groaning in a corner, with his leg broken.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She carried him down, and then hurried with loud
protestations to the youth's father. &quot;Your son has been the cause of a
pretty misfortune,&quot; she cried; &quot;he threw my husband downstairs so
that he broke his leg. Take the good-for-nothing wretch out of our house.&quot;
The father was horrified, hurried to the youth, and gave him a scolding.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What unholy pranks are these? The evil one
must have put them into your head.&quot; &quot;Father,&quot; he replied,
&quot;only listen to me; I am quite guiltless. He stood there in the night,
like one who meant harm. I didn't know who it was, and warned him three times
to speak or begone.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; groaned the father, &quot;you'll bring
me nothing but misfortune; get out of my sight, I won't have anything more to
do with you.&quot; &quot;Yes, father, willingly; only wait till daylight, then
I'll set out and learn to shudder, and in that way I shall be master of an art
which will gain me a living.&quot; &quot;Learn what you will,&quot; said the
father, &quot;it's all one to me. Here are fifty dollars for you, set forth
into the wide world with them; but see you tell no one where you come from or
who your father is, for I am ashamed of you.&quot; &quot;Yes, father, whatever
you wish; and if that's all you ask, I can easily keep it in mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When day broke the youth put the fifty dollars
into his pocket, set out on the hard high road, and kept muttering to himself:
&quot;If I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!&quot; Just at this
moment a man came by who heard the youth speaking to himself, and when they had
gone on a bit and were in sight of the gallows the man said to him: &quot;Look!
there is the tree where seven people have been hanged, and are now learning to
fly; sit down under it and wait till nightfall, and then you'll pretty soon
learn to shudder.&quot; &quot;If that's all I have to do,&quot; answered the
youth, &quot;it's easily done; but if I learn to shudder so quickly, then you
shall have my fifty dollars. Just come back to me tomorrow morning early.&quot;
Then the youth went to the gallows-tree and sat down underneath it, and waited
for the evening; and because he felt cold he lit himself a fire. But at
midnight it got so chill that in spite of the fire he couldn't keep warm. And
as the wind blew the corpses one against the other, tossing them to and fro, he
thought to himself: &quot;If you are perishing down here by the fire, how those
poor things up there must be shaking and shivering!&quot; And because he had a
tender heart, he put up a ladder, which he climbed unhooked one body after the other,
and took down all the seven. Then he stirred the fire, blew it up, and placed
them all round in a circle, that they might warm themselves. But they sat there
and did not move, and the fire caught their clothes. Then he spoke: &quot;Take
care, or I'll hang you up again.&quot; But the dead men did not hear and let
their rags go on burning. Then he got angry, and said: &quot;If you aren't
careful yourselves, then I can't help you, and I don't mean to burn with
you&quot;; and he hung them up again in a row. Then he sat down at his fire and
fell asleep. On the following morning the man came to him, and, wishing to get
his fifty dollars, said: &quot;Now you know what it is to shudder.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; he answered, &quot;how should I? Those fellows up there never
opened their mouths, and were so stupid that they let those few old tatters
they have on their bodies burn.&quot; Then the man saw he wouldn't get his
fifty dollars that day, and went off, saying: &quot;Well, I'm blessed if I ever
met such a person in my life before.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The youth went too on his way, and began to
murmur to himself: &quot;Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only
shudder!&quot; A carrier who was walking behind him heard these words, and
asked him: &quot;Who are you&quot; &quot;I don't know,&quot; said the youth.
&quot;Where do you hail from?&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot; &quot;Who's your
father?&quot; &quot;I mayn't say.&quot; &quot;What are you constantly muttering
to yourself?&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; said the youth, &quot;I would give worlds to
shudder, but no one can teach me.&quot; &quot;Stuff and nonsense!&quot; spoke
the carrier; &quot;come along with me, and I'll soon put that right.&quot; The
youth went with the carrier, and in the evening they reached an inn, where they
were to spend the night. Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again,
quite aloud: &quot;Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!&quot;
The landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: &quot;If that's what you're
sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here.&quot; &quot;Oh! hold
your tongue!&quot; said the landlord's wife; &quot;so many people have paid for
their curiosity with their lives, it were a thousand pities if those beautiful
eyes were never again to behold daylight.&quot; But the youth said: &quot;No
matter how difficult, I insist on learning it; why, that's what I've set out to
do.&quot; He left the landlord no peace till he told him that in the
neighborhood stood a haunted castle, where one could easily learn to shudder if
one only kept watch in it for three nights. The King had promised the man who
dared to do this thing his daughter as wife, and she was the most beautiful
maiden under the sun. There was also much treasure hid in the castle, guarded
by evil spirits, which would then be free, and was sufficient to make a poor
man more than rich. Many had already gone in, but so far none had ever come out
again. So the youth went to the King and spoke: &quot;If I were allowed, I
should much like to watch for three nights in the castle.&quot; The King looked
at him, and because he pleased him, he said: &quot;You can ask for three
things, none of them living, and those you may take with you into the
castle.&quot; Then he answered: &quot;Well, I shall beg for a fire, a turning
lathe, and a carving bench with the knife attached.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the following day the King had everything put
into the castle; and when night drew on the youth took up his position there,
lit a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the carving bench with the knife
close to it, and sat himself down on the turning lathe. &quot;Oh! if I could
only shudder!&quot; he said: &quot;but I sha'n't learn it here either.&quot;
Toward midnight he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze
he heard a shriek from a corner. &quot;Ou, miou! how cold we are!&quot;
&quot;You fools!&quot; he cried; &quot;why do you scream? If you are cold, come
and sit at the fire and warm yourselves.&quot; And as he spoke two huge black
cats sprang fiercely forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed
wildly at him with their fiery eyes. After a time, when they had warmed
themselves, they said: &quot;Friend, shall we play a little game of
cards?&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; he replied; &quot;but first let me see your
paws.&quot; Then they stretched out their claws. &quot;Ha!&quot; said he;
&quot;what long nails you've got! Wait a minute: I must first cut them
off.&quot; Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their necks, lifted them
on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws firmly. &quot;After
watching you narrowly,&quot; said he, &quot;I no longer feel any desire to play
cards with you&quot;; and with these words he struck them dead and threw them
out into the water. But when he had thus sent the two of them to their final
rest, and was again about to sit down at the fire, out of every nook and corner
came forth black cats and black dogs with fiery chains in such swarms that he
couldn't possibly get away from them. They yelled in the most ghastly manner,
jumped upon his fire, scattered it all, and tried to put it out. He looked on
quietly for a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife
and called out: &quot;Be off, you rabble rout!&quot; and let fly at them. Some
of them fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the
pond below. When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once more, and
warmed himself. And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer,
and a desire to sleep stole over him. Then he looked around him and beheld in
the corner a large bed. &quot;The very thing,&quot; he said, and laid himself
down in it. But when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by
itself, and ran all round the castle. &quot;Capital,&quot; he said, &quot;only
a little quicker.&quot; Then the bed sped on as if drawn by six horses, over
thresholds and stairs, up this way and down that. All of a sudden--crash,
crash! with a bound it turned over, upside down, and lay like a mountain on the
top of him. But he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from
underneath, and said: &quot;Now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a
drive,&quot; lay down at his fire, and slept till daylight. In the morning the
King came, and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts
had been too much for him, and that he was dead. Then he said: &quot;What a
pity! and such a fine fellow he was.&quot; The youth heard this, got up, and
said: &quot;It's not come to that yet.&quot; Then the King was astonished, but
very glad, and asked how it had fared with him. &quot;First-rate,&quot; he
answered; &quot;and now I've survived the one night, I shall get through the
other two also.&quot; The landlord, when he went to him, opened his eyes wide,
and said: &quot;Well, I never thought to see you alive again. Have you learned
now what shuddering is ?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;it's quite
hopeless; if someone could only tell me how to!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The second night he went up again to the old
castle, sat down at the fire, and began his old refrain: &quot;If I could only
shudder!&quot; As midnight approached, a noise and din broke out, at first
gentle, but gradually increasing; then all was quiet for a minute, and at
length, with a loud scream, half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell
before him. &quot;Hi, up there!&quot; shouted he; &quot;there's another half
wanted down here, that's not enough&quot;; then the din commenced once more,
there was a shrieking and a yelling, and then the other half fell down.
&quot;Wait a bit,&quot; he said; &quot;I'll stir up the fire for you.&quot;
When he had done this and again looked around, the two pieces had united, and a
horrible-looking man sat on his seat. &quot;Come,&quot; said the youth, &quot;I
didn't bargain for that, the seat is mine.&quot; The man tried to shove him
away, but the youth wouldn't allow it for a moment, and, pushing him off by
force, sat down in his place again. Then more men dropped down, one after the
other, who fetching nine skeleton legs and two skulls, put them up and played
ninepins with them. The youth thought he would like to play too, and said:
&quot;Look here; do you mind my joining the game?&quot; &quot;No, not if you
have money.&quot; &quot;I've money enough,&quot; he replied, &quot;but your
balls aren't round enough.&quot; Then he took the skulls, placed them on his
lathe, and turned them till they were round. &quot;Now they'll roll along
better,&quot; said he, &quot;and houp-la! now the fun begins.&quot; He played
with them and lost some of his money, but when twelve struck everything
vanished before his eyes. He lay down and slept peacefully. The next morning
the King came, anxious for news. &quot;How have you got on this time?&quot; he
asked. &quot;I played ninepins,&quot; he answered, &quot;and lost a few
pence.&quot; &quot;Didn't you shudder then?&quot; &quot;No such luck,&quot;
said he; &quot;I made myself merry. Oh! if I only knew what it was to
shudder!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On the third night he sat down again on his
bench, and said, in the most desponding way: &quot;If I could only
shudder!&quot; When it got late, six big men came in carrying a coffin. Then he
cried: &quot;Ha! ha! that's most likely my little cousin who only died a few
days ago&quot;; and beckoning with his finger he called out: &quot;Come, my
small cousin, come.&quot; They placed the coffin on the ground, and he
approached it and took off the cover. In it lay a dead man. He felt his face,
and it was cold as ice. &quot;Wait,&quot; he said &quot;I'll heat you up a
bit,&quot; went to the fire, warmed his hand, and laid it on the man's face,
but the dead remained cold. Then he lifted him out, sat down at the fire, laid
him on his knee, and rubbed his arms that the blood should circulate again.
When that too had no effect it occurred to him that if two people lay together
in bed they warmed each other; so he put him into the bed, covered him up, and
lay down beside him; after a time the corpse became warm and began to move.
Then the youth said: &quot;Now, my little cousin, what would have happened if I
hadn't warmed you?&quot; But the dead man rose up and cried out: &quot;Now I
will strangle you.&quot; &quot;What!&quot; said he, &quot;is that all the
thanks I get? You should be put straight back into your coffin,&quot; lifted
him up, threw him in, and closed the lid. Then the six men came and carried him
out again. &quot;I simply can't shudder,&quot; he said, &quot;and it's clear I
sha'n't learn it in a lifetime here.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then a man entered, of more than ordinary size
and of a very fearful appearance; but he was old and had a white beard.
&quot;Oh! you miserable creature, now you will soon know what it is to
shudder,&quot; he cried, &quot;for you must die.&quot; &quot;Not so
quickly,&quot; answered the youth. &quot;If I am to die, you must catch me
first.&quot; &quot;I shall soon lay hold of you,&quot; spoke the monster.
&quot;Gently, gently, don't boast too much, I'm as strong as you, and stronger
too.&quot; &quot;We'll soon see,&quot; said the old man; &quot;if you are
stronger than I then I'll let you off; come, let's have a try.&quot; Then he
led him through some dark passages to a forge, and grasping an axe he drove one
of the anvils with a blow into the earth. &quot;I can do better than
that,&quot; cried the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man drew near
him in order to watch closely, and his white beard hung right down. The youth
seized the axe, cleft the anvil open, and jammed in the old man's beard.
&quot;Now I have you,&quot; said the youth; &quot;this time it's your turn to
die.&quot; Then he seized an iron rod and belabored the old man till he,
whimpering, begged him to leave off, and he would give him great riches. The
youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back to the castle
and showed him in a cellar three chests of gold. &quot;One of these,&quot; said
he, &quot;belongs to the poor, one to the King, and the third is yours.&quot;
At that moment twelve struck, and the spirit vanished, leaving the youth alone
in the dark. &quot;I'll surely be able to find a way out,&quot; said he, and
groping about he at length found his way back to the room, and fell asleep at
his fire. The next morning the King came, and said: &quot;Well, now you've
surely learned to shudder?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he answered; &quot;what can it
be? My dead cousin was here, and an old bearded man came, who showed me heaps
of money down below there, but what shuddering is no one has told me.&quot;
Then the King spoke: &quot;You have freed the castle from its curse, and you
shall marry my daughter.&quot; &quot;That's all charming,&quot; he said; abut I
still don't know what it is to shudder.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the gold was brought up, and the wedding
was celebrated, but the young King, though he loved his wife dearly, and though
he was very happy, still kept on saying: &quot;If I could only shudder! if I
could only shudder!&quot; At last he reduced her to despair. Then her maid
said: &quot;I'll help you; we'll soon make him shudder.&quot; So she went out
to the stream that flowed through the garden, and had a pail full of little
gudgeons brought to her. At night, when the young King was asleep, his wife had
to pull the clothes off him, and pour the pail full of little gudgeons over
him, so that the little fish swam all about him. Then he awoke and cried out:
&quot;Oh! how I shudder, how I shudder, dear wife! Yes, now I know what
shuddering is.&quot;</span></p>
