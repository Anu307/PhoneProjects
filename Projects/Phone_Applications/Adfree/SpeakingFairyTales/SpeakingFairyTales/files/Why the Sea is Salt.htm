<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe WP Semibold","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;Why
the Sea is Salt</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time, long, long ago, there were two
brothers, the one rich and the other poor. When Christmas Eve came, the poor
one had not a bite in the house, either of meat or bread; so he went to his
brother, and begged him, in God's name, to give him something for Christmas
Day. It was by no means the first time that the brother had been forced to give
something to him, and he was not better pleased at being asked now than he
generally was.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you will do what I ask you, you shall
have a whole ham,&quot; said he. The poor one immediately thanked him, and
promised this.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, here is the ham, and now you must go
straight to Dead Man's Hall,&quot; said the rich brother, throwing the ham to
him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, I will do what I have
promised,&quot; said the other, and he took the ham and set off. He went on and
on for the livelong day, and at nightfall he came to a place where there was a
bright light.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have no doubt this is the place,&quot;
thought the man with the ham.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>An old man with a long white beard was standing
in the outhouse, chopping Yule logs.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good-evening,&quot; said the man with the
ham.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good-evening to you. Where are you going
at this late hour?&quot; said the man.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am going to Dead Man's Hall, if only I
am on the right track,&quot; answered the poor man.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! yes, you are right enough, for it is
here,&quot; said the old man. &quot;When you get inside they will all want to
buy your ham, for they don't get much meat to eat there; but you must not sell
it unless you can get the hand-mill which stands behind the door for it. When
you come out again I will teach you how to stop the hand-mill, which is useful
for almost everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the man with the ham thanked the other for
his good advice, and rapped at the door.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he got in, everything happened just as the
old man had said it would: all the people, great and small, came round him like
ants on an ant-hill, and each tried to outbid the other for the ham.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;By rights my old woman and I ought to have
it for our Christmas dinner, but, since you have set your hearts upon it, I
must just give it up to you,&quot; said the man. &quot;But, if I sell it, I
will have the hand-mill which is standing there behind the door.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At first they would not hear to this, and
haggled and bargained with the man, but he stuck to what he had said, and the
people were forced to give him the hand-mill. When the man came out again into
the yard, he asked the old wood-cutter how he was to stop the hand-mill, and
when he had learned that, he thanked him and set off home with all the speed he
could, but did not get there until after the clock had struck twelve on
Christmas Eve.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Where in the world have you been?&quot;
said the old woman. &quot;Here I have sat waiting hour after hour, and have not
even two sticks to lay across each other under the Christmas
porridge-pot.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! I could not come before; I had
something of importance to see about, and a long way to go, too; but now you
shall just see!&quot; said the man, and then he set the hand-mill on the table,
and bade it first grind light, then a table-cloth, and then meat, and beer, and
everything else that was good for a Christmas Eve's supper; and the mill ground
all that he ordered. &quot;Bless me!&quot; said the old woman as one thing
after another appeared; and she wanted to know where her husband had got the
mill from, but he would not tell her that.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Never mind where I got it; you can see
that it is a good one, and the water that turns it will never freeze,&quot;
said the man. So he ground meat and drink, and all kinds of good things, to
last all Christmas-tide, and on the third day he invited all his friends to
come to a feast.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now when the rich brother saw all that there was
at the banquet and in the house, he was both vexed and angry, for he grudged
everything his brother had. &quot;On Christmas Eve he was so poor that he came
to me and begged for a trifle, for God's sake, and now he gives a feast as if
he were both a count and a king!&quot; thought he. &quot;But, for heaven's sake,
tell me where you got your riches from,&quot; said he to his brother.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;From behind the door,&quot; said he who
owned the mill, for he did not choose to satisfy his brother on that point; but
later in the evening, when he had taken a drop too much, he could not refrain
from telling how he had come by the hand-mill. &quot;There you see what has
brought me all my wealth!&quot; said he, and brought out the mill, and made it
grind first one thing and then another. When the brother saw that, he insisted
on having the mill, and after a great deal of persuasion got it; but he had to
give three hundred dollars for it, and the poor brother was to keep it till the
haymaking was over, for he thought: &quot;If I keep it as long as that, I can
make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year.&quot; During that
time you may imagine that the mill did not grow rusty, and when hay- harvest
came the rich brother got it, but the other had taken good care not to teach
him how to stop it. It was evening when the rich man got the mill home, and in
the morning he bade the old woman go out and spread the hay after the mowers,
and he would attend to the house himself that day, he said.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So, when dinner-time drew near, he set the mill
on the kitchen-table, and said: &quot;Grind herrings and milk pottage, and do
it both quickly and well.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the mill began to grind herrings and milk
pottage, and first all the dishes and tubs were filled, and then it came out
all over the kitchen-floor. The man twisted and turned it, and did all he could
to make the mill stop, but, howsoever he turned it and screwed it, the mill
went on grinding, and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was
like to be drowned. So he threw open the parlor door, but it was not long
before the mill had ground the parlor full too, and it was with difficulty and
danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the
door-latch. When he got the door open, he did not stay long in the room, but
ran out, and the herrings and pottage came after him, and it streamed out over
both farm and field. Now the old woman, who was out spreading the hay, began to
think dinner was long in coming, and said to the women and the mowers:
&quot;Though the master does not call us home, we may as well go. It may be
that he finds he is not good at making pottage and I should do well to help
him.&quot; So they began to straggle homeward, but when they had got a little
way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread, all pouring forth
and winding about one over the other, and the man himself in front of the
flood. &quot;Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs! Take care
that you are not drowned in the pottage!&quot; he cried as he went by them as
if Mischief were at his heels, down to where his brother dwelt. Then he begged
him, for God's sake, to take the mill back again, and that in an instant, for,
said he: &quot;If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed
by herrings and pottage.&quot; But the brother would not take it until the
other paid him three hundred dollars, and that he was obliged to do. Now the
poor brother had both the money and the mill again. So it was not long before
he had a farmhouse much finer than that in which his brother lived, but the
mill ground him so much money that he covered it with plates of gold; and the
farmhouse lay close by the sea-shore, so it shone and glittered far out to sea.
Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the
gold farmhouse, and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill, for the report
of it spread far and wide, and there was no one who had not heard tell of it.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>After a long, long time came also a skipper who
wished to see the mill. He asked if it could make salt. &quot;Yes, it could
make salt,&quot; said he who owned it, and when the skipper heard that, he
wished with all his might and main to have the mill, let it cost what it might,
for, he thought, if he had it, he would get off having to sail far away over
the perilous sea for freights of salt. At first the man would not hear of
parting with it, but the skipper begged and prayed, and at last the man sold it
to him, and got many, many thousand dollars for it. When the skipper had got
the mill on his back he did not stay there long, for he was so afraid that the
man would change his mind, and he had no time to ask how he was to stop it
grinding, but got on board his ship as fast as he could.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he had gone a little way out to sea he took
the mill on deck. &quot;Grind salt, and grind both quickly and well,&quot; said
the skipper. So the mill began to grind salt, till it spouted out like water,
and when the skipper had got the ship filled he wanted to stop the mill, but
whichsoever way he turned it, and how much soever he tried, it went on
grinding, and the heap of salt grew higher and higher, until at last the ship
sank. There lies the mill at the bottom of the sea, and still, day by day, it
grinds on; and that is why the sea is salt.</span></p>
