<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe WP Semibold","sans-serif"'>The
Bronze Ring</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time in a certain country there
lived a king whose palace was surrounded by a spacious garden. But, though the
gardeners were many and the soil was good, this garden yielded neither flowers
nor fruits, not even grass or shady trees.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King was in despair about it, when a wise
old man said to him:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your gardeners do not understand their
business: but what can you expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and
carpenters? How should they have learned to cultivate your garden?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;You are quite right,&quot; cried the King.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Therefore,&quot; continued the old man,
&quot;you should send for a gardener whose father and grandfather have been
gardeners before him, and very soon your garden will be full of green grass and
gay flowers, and you will enjoy its delicious fruit.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the King sent messengers to every town,
village, and hamlet in his dominions, to look for a gardener whose forefathers
had been gardeners also, and after forty days one was found.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Come with us and be gardener to the
King,&quot; they said to him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How can I go to the King,&quot; said the
gardener, &quot;a poor wretch like me?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;That is of no consequence,&quot; they
answered. &quot;Here are new clothes for you and your family.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But I owe money to several people.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We will pay your debts,&quot; they said.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded,
and went away with the messengers, taking his wife and his son with him; and
the King, delighted to have found a real gardener, entrusted him with the care
of his garden. The man found no difficulty in making the royal garden produce
flowers and fruit, and at the end of a year the park was not like the same
place, and the King showered gifts upon his new servant.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener, as you have heard already, had a
son, who was a very handsome young man, with most agree- able manners, and
every day he carried the best fruit of the garden to the King, and all the
prettiest flowers to his daughter. Now this princess was wonderfully pretty and
was just sixteen years old, and the King was beginning to think it was time
that she should be married.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My dear child,&quot; said he, &quot;you
are of an age to take a husband, therefore I am thinking of marrying you to the
son of my prime minister.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Father,&quot; replied the Princess,
&quot;I will never marry the son of the minister.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why not?&quot; asked the King.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Because I love the gardener's son,&quot;
answered the Princess.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>On hearing this the King was at first very
angry, and then he wept and sighed, and declared that such a husband was not
worthy of his daughter; but the young Princess was not to be turned from her
resolution to marry the gardener's son.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the King consulted his ministers.
&quot;This is what you must do,&quot; they said. &quot;To get rid of the
gardener you must send both suitors to a very distant country, and the one who
returns first shall marry your daughter.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King followed this advice, and the
minister's son was presented with a splendid horse and a purse full of gold
pieces, while the gardener's son had only an old lame horse and a purse full of
copper money, and every one thought he would never come back from his journey.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The day before they started the Princess met her
lover and said to him:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Be brave, and remember always that I love
you. Take this purse full of jewels and make the best use you can of them for
love of me, and come back quickly and demand my hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The two suitors left the town together, but the
minister's son went off at a gallop on his good horse, and very soon was lost
to sight behind the most distant hills. He traveled on for some days, and
presently reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a
stone.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good-day to you, young traveler,&quot;
said she.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But the minister's son made no reply.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have pity upon me, traveler,&quot; she
said again. &quot;I am dying of hunger, as you see, and three days have I been
here and no one has given me anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let me alone, old witch,&quot; cried the
young man; &quot;I can do nothing for you,&quot; and so saying he went on his
way.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That same evening the gardener's son rode up to
the fountain upon his lame gray horse.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good-day to you, young traveler,&quot;
said the beggar- woman.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Good-day, good woman,&quot; answered he.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Young traveler, have pity upon me.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Take my purse, good woman,&quot; said he,
&quot;and mount behind me, for your legs can't be very strong.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old woman didn't wait to be asked twice, but
mounted behind him, and in this style they reached the chief city of a powerful
kingdom. The minister's son was lodged in a grand inn, the gardener's son and
the old woman dismounted at the inn for beggars.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day the gardener's son heard a great
noise in the street, and the King's heralds passed, blowing all kinds of
instruments, and crying:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King, our master, is old and infirm. He will
give a great reward to whoever will cure him and give him back the strength of
his youth.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the old beggar-woman said to her
benefactor:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This is what you must do to obtain the
reward which the King promises. Go out of the town by the south gate, and there
you will find three little dogs of different colors; the first will be white,
the second black, the third red. You must kill them and then burn them
separately, and gather up the ashes. Put the ashes of each dog into a bag of
its own color, then go before the door of the palace and cry out, `A celebrated
physician has come from Janina in Albania. He alone can cure the King and give
him back the strength of his youth.' The King's physicians will say, This is an
impostor, and not a learned man,' and they will make all sorts of difficulties,
but you will overcome them all at last, and will present yourself before the
sick King. You must then demand as much wood as three mules can carry, and a
great cauldron, and must shut yourself up in a room with the Sultan, and when
the cauldron boils you must throw him into it, and there leave him until his
flesh is completely separated from his bones. Then arrange the bones in their
proper places, and throw over them the ashes out of the three bags. The King
will come back to life, and will be just as he was when he was twenty years
old. For your reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to
grant you everything you desire. Go, my son, and do not forget any of my
instructions.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young man followed the old beggar-woman's
directions. On going out of the town he found the white, red, and black dogs,
and killed and burnt them, gathering the ashes in three bags. Then he ran to
the palace and cried:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A celebrated physician has just come from
Janina in Albania. He alone can cure the King and give him back the strength of
his youth.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King's physicians at first laughed at the
unknown wayfarer, but the Sultan ordered that the stranger should be admitted.
They brought the cauldron and the loads of wood, and very soon the King was
boiling away. Toward mid-day the gardener's son arranged the bones in their
places, and he had hardly scattered the ashes over them before the old King
revived, to find himself once more young and hearty.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How can I reward you, my benefactor?&quot;
he cried. &quot;Will you take half my treasures?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No,&quot; said the gardener's son.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My daughter's hand?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;NO.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take half my kingdom.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No. Give me only the bronze ring which can
instantly grant me anything I wish for.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot; said the King, &quot;I set
great store by that marvelous ring; nevertheless, you shall have it.&quot; And
he gave it to him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The gardener's son went back to say good-by to
the old beggar-woman; then he said to the bronze ring:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Prepare a splendid ship in which I may
continue my journey. Let the hull be of fine gold, the masts of silver, the
sails of brocade; let the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance,
dressed like kings. St. Nicholas will be at the helm. As to the cargo, let it
be diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and carbuncles.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea
which resembled in every particular THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE GARDENER'S
SON, and, stepping on board, he continued his journey. Presently he arrived at
a great town and established himself in a wonderful palace. After several days
he met his rival, the minister's son, who had spent all his money and was
reduced to the disagreeable employment of a carrier of dust and rubbish. The
gardener's son said to him:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What is your name, what is your family, and
from what country do you come?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am the son of the prime minister of a
great nation, and yet see what a degrading occupation I am reduced to.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Listen to me; though I don't know anything
more about you, I am willing to help you. I will give you a ship to take you
back to your own country upon one condition.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Whatever it may be, I accept it
willingly.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Follow me to my palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The minister's son followed the rich stranger,
whom he had not recognized. When they reached the palace the gardener's son
made a sign to his slaves, who completely undressed the new-comer.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Make this ring red-hot,&quot; commanded
the master, &quot;and mark the man with it upon his back.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The slaves obeyed him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, young man,&quot; said the rich
stranger, &quot;I am going to give you a vessel which will take you back to
your own country.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And, going out, he took the bronze ring and
said:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Bronze ring, obey thy master. Prepare me a
ship of which the half-rotten timbers shall be painted black, let the sails be
in rags, and the sailors infirm and sickly. One shall have lost a leg, another
an arm, the third shall be a hunchback, another lame or club-footed or blind,
and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars. Go, and let my orders be
executed.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The minister's son embarked in this old vessel,
and thanks to favorable winds, at length reached his own country. In spite of
the pitiable condition in which he returned they received him joyfully.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am the first to come back,&quot; said he
to the King; now fulfil your promise, and give me the princess in marriage.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So they at once began to prepare for the wedding
festivities. As to the poor princess, she was sorrowful and angry enough about
it.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next morning, at daybreak, a wonderful ship
with every sail set came to anchor before the town. The King happened at that
moment to be at the palace window.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What strange ship is this,&quot; he cried,
&quot;that has a golden hull, silver masts, and silken sails, and who are the
young men like princes who man it? And do I not see St. Nicholas at the helm?
Go at once and invite the captain of the ship to come to the palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>His servants obeyed him, and very soon in came
an enchantingly handsome young prince, dressed in rich silk, ornamented with
pearls and diamonds.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Young man,&quot; said the King, &quot;you
are welcome, whoever you may be. Do me the favor to be my guest as long as you
remain in my capital.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Many thanks, sire,&quot; replied the
captain, &quot;I accept your offer.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My daughter is about to be married,&quot;
said the King; &quot;will you give her away?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I shall be charmed, sire.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon after came the Princess and her betrothed.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why, how is this?&quot; cried the young
captain; &quot;would you marry this charming princess to such a man as
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;But he is my prime minister's son!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What does that matter? I cannot give your daughter
away. The man she is betrothed to is one of my servants.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your servant?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Without doubt. I met him in a distant town
reduced to carrying away dust and rubbish from the houses. I had pity on him
and engaged him as one of my servants.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is impossible!&quot; cried the King.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you wish me to prove what I say? This
young man returned in a vessel which I fitted out for him, an unsea- worthy
ship with a black battered hull, and the sailors were infirm and
crippled.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is quite true,&quot; said the King.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is false,&quot; cried the minister's
son. &quot;I do not know this man!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said the young captain,
&quot;order your daughter's betrothed to be stripped, and see if the mark of my
ring is not branded upon his back.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King was about to give this order, when the
minister's son, to save himself from such an indignity, admitted that the story
was true.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;And now, sire,&quot; said the young
captain, &quot;do you not recognize me?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I recognize you,&quot; said the Princess;
&quot;you are the gardener's son whom I have always loved, and it is you I wish
to marry.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Young man, you shall be my
son-in-law,&quot; cried the King. &quot;The marriage festivities are already
begun, so you shall marry my daughter this very day.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And so that very day the gardener's son married
the beautiful Princess.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Several months passed. The young couple were as
happy as the day was long, and the King was more and more pleased with himself
for having secured such a son- in-law.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But, presently, the captain of the golden ship
found it necessary to take a long voyage, and after embracing his wife tenderly
he embarked.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now in the outskirts of the capital there lived
an old man, who had spent his life in studying black arts-- alchemy, astrology,
magic, and enchantment. This man found out that the gardener's son had only
succeeded in marrying the Princess by the help of the genii who obeyed the
bronze ring.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will have that ring,&quot; said he to
himself. So he went down to the sea-shore and caught some little red fishes.
Really, they were quite wonderfully pretty. Then he came back, and, passing
before the Princess's window, he began to cry out:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Who wants some pretty little red
fishes?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Princess heard him, and sent out one of her
slaves, who said to the old peddler:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What will you take for your fish?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A bronze ring.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A bronze ring, old simpleton! And where
shall I find one?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Under the cushion in the Princess's
room.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The slave went back to her mistress.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The old madman will take neither gold nor
silver,&quot; said she.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What does he want then?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A bronze ring that is hidden under a
cushion.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Find the ring and give it to him,&quot; said the
Princess.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And at last the slave found the bronze ring,
which the captain of the golden ship had accidentally left behind and carried
it to the man, who made off with it instantly.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hardly had he reached his own house when, taking
the ring, he said, &quot;Bronze ring, obey thy master. I desire that the golden
ship shall turn to black wood, and the crew to hideous negroes; that St.
Nicholas shall leave the helm and that the only cargo shall be black
cats.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And the genii of the bronze ring obeyed him.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Finding himself upon the sea in this miserable
condition, the young captain understood that some one must have stolen the
bronze ring from him, and he lamented his misfortune loudly; but that did him
no good.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas!&quot; he said to himself,
&quot;whoever has taken my ring has probably taken my dear wife also. What good
will it do me to go back to my own country?&quot; And he sailed about from
island to island, and from shore to shore, believing that wherever he went
everybody was laughing at him, and very soon his poverty was so great that he
and his crew and the poor black cats had nothing to eat but herbs and roots.
After wandering about a long time he reached an island inhabited by mice. The
captain landed upon the shore and began to explore the country. There were mice
everywhere, and nothing but mice. Some of the black cats had followed him, and,
not having been fed for several days, they were fearfully hungry, and made
terrible havoc among the mice.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the queen of the mice held a council.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;These cats will eat every one of us,&quot;
she said, &quot;if the captain of the ship does not shut the ferocious animals
up. Let us send a deputation to him of the bravest among us.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Several mice offered themselves for this mission
and set out to find the young captain.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Captain,&quot; said they, &quot;go away
quickly from our island, or we shall perish, every mouse of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Willingly,&quot; replied the young
captain, &quot;upon one condition. That is that you shall first bring me back a
bronze ring which some clever magician has stolen from me. If you do not do
this I will land all my cats upon your island, and you shall be
exterminated.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The mice withdrew in great dismay. &quot;What is
to be done?&quot; said the Queen. &quot;How can we find this bronze ring?&quot;
She held a new council, calling in mice from every quarter of the globe, but
nobody knew where the bronze ring was. Suddenly three mice arrived from a very
distant country. One was blind, the second lame, and the third had her ears cropped.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho, ho, ho!&quot; said the new-comers.
&quot;We come from a far distant country.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you know where the bronze ring is which
the genii obey?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho, ho, ho! we know; an old sorcerer has
taken possession of it, and now he keeps it in his pocket by day and in his
mouth by night.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Go and take it from him, and come back as
soon as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the three mice made themselves a boat and set
sail for the magician's country. When they reached the capital they landed and
ran to the palace, leaving only the blind mouse on the shore to take care of
the boat. Then they waited till it was night. The wicked old man lay down in
bed and put the bronze ring into his mouth, and very soon he was asleep.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, what shall we do?&quot; said the two
little animals to each other.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The mouse with the cropped ears found a lamp
full of oil and a bottle full of pepper. So she dipped her tail first in the
oil and then in the pepper, and held it to the sorcerer's nose.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Atisha! atisha!&quot; sneezed the old man,
but he did not wake, and the shock made the bronze ring jump out of his mouth.
Quick as thought the lame mouse snatched up the precious talisman and carried
it off to the boat.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Imagine the despair of the magician when he
awoke and the bronze ring was nowhere to be found!</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But by that time our three mice had set sail
with their prize. A favoring breeze was carrying them toward the island where
the queen of the mice was awaiting them. Naturally they began to talk about the
bronze ring.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Which of us deserves the most
credit?&quot; they cried all at once.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I do,&quot; said the blind mouse,
&quot;for without my watchfulness our boat would have drifted away to the open
sea.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; cried the mouse with the
cropped ears; &quot;the credit is mine. Did I not cause the ring to jump out of
the man's mouth?&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No, it is mine,&quot; cried the lame one,
&quot;for I ran off with the ring.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>And from high words they soon came to blows,
and, alas! when the quarrel was fiercest the bronze ring fell into the sea.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How are we to face our queen,&quot; said
the three mice &quot;when by our folly we have lost the talisman and condemned
our people to be utterly exterminated? We cannot go back to our country; let us
land on this desert island and there end our miserable lives.&quot; No sooner
said than done. The boat reached the island, and the mice landed.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The blind mouse was speedily deserted by her two
sisters, who went off to hunt flies, but as she wandered sadly along the shore
she found a dead fish, and was eating it, when she felt something very hard. At
her cries the other two mice ran up.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;It is the bronze ring! It is the
talisman!&quot; they cried joyfully, and, getting into their boat again, they
soon reached the mouse island. It was time they did, for the captain was just
going to land his cargo of cats, when a deputation of mice brought him the
precious bronze ring.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Bronze ring,&quot; commanded the young
man, &quot;obey thy master. Let my ship appear as it was before.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Immediately the genii of the ring set to work,
and the old black vessel became once more the wonderful golden ship with sails
of brocade; the handsome sailors ran to the silver masts and the silken ropes,
and very soon they set sail for the capital.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Ah! how merrily the sailors sang as they flew
over the glassy sea!</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last the port was reached.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The captain landed and ran to the palace, where
he found the wicked old man asleep. The Princess clasped her husband in a long
embrace. The magician tried to escape, but he was seized and bound with strong
cords.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The next day the sorcerer, tied to the tail of a
savage mule loaded with nuts, was broken into as many pieces as there were nuts
upon the mule's back. </span></p>
