Thumb heard every word that had been spoken; for observing, as he lay in his
bed, that they were talking very busily, he got up softly, and hid himself
under his father's stool, that he might hear what they said without being seen.
He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night,
thinking on what he had to do. He got up early in the morning, and went to the
river-side, where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then
returned home.</span></p>

went abroad, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he
knew. They went into a very thick forest, where they could not another at ten
paces distance. The fagot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather
up the sticks to make fagots. Their father and mother, seeing them busy at
their work, got away from them insensibly, and ran away from them all at once,
along a by-way through the winding bushes.</span></p>

children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loud as they could.
Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get home again, for, as
he came, he took care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had
in his pockets. Then he said to them:</span></p>

so, and he brought them home by the very same way they came into the forest.

their father and mother were saying.</span></p>

moment the fagot-maker and his wife reached home the lord of the manor sent
them ten crowns, which he had owed them a long while, and which they never
expected. This gave them new life, for the poor people were almost famished.
The fagot-maker sent his wife immediately to the butcher's. As it was a long
while since they had eaten a bit, she bought thrice as much meat as would sup
two people. When they had eaten, the woman said:</span></p>

left here; but it was you, William, who had a mind to lose them: I told you we
should repent of it. What are they now doing in the forest? Alas! dear God, the
wolves have perhaps already eaten them up; thou art very inhuman thus to have
lost thy children.&quot;</span></p>

fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated it above
twenty times, that they should repent of it, and that she was in the right of
it for so saying. He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. It
was not that the fagot-maker was not, perhaps, more vexed than his wife, but
that she teased him, and that he was of the humor of a great many others, who
love wives to speak well, but think those very importunate who are continually
doing so. She was half-drowned in tears, crying out:</span></p>

must know that Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved above all the rest,
because he was somewhat carroty, as she herself was. They sat down to supper,
and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother, whom they
acquainted how frightened they were in the forest, speaking almost always all
together. The good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at
home, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money
was all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and resolved to
lose them again; and, that they might be the surer of doing it, to carry them
to a much greater distance than before.</span></p>

not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by Little Thumb, who made
account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former; but, though he got
up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles, he was
disappointed, for he found the house- door double-locked, and was at a stand
what to do. When their father had given each of them a piece of bread for their
breakfast, Little Thumb fancied he might make use of this instead of the
pebbles by throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pass; and
so he put the bread in his pocket.</span></p>

father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the
forest, when, stealing away into a by-path, they there left them. Little Thumb
was not very uneasy at it, for he thought he could easily find the way again by
means of his bread, which he had scattered all along as he came; but he was
very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb; the birds had
come and had eaten it up, every bit. They were now in great affliction, for the
farther they went the more they were out of their way, and were more and more
bewildered in the forest.</span></p>

came on, and there arose a terribly high wind, which made them dreadfully
afraid. They fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves
coming to eat them up. They scarce dared to speak or turn their heads. After
this, it rained very hard, which wetted them to the skin; their feet slipped at
every step they took, and they fell into the mire, whence they got up in a very
dirty pickle; their hands were quite benumbed.</span></p>

light, like that of a candle, but a long way from the forest. He came down,

over and above mischievous, but they promised very fair for it, for they had
already bitten little children, that they might suck their blood.</span></p>

pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife. So soon as
Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and bade them all put
on their clothes presently and follow him. They stole down softly into the
garden, and got over the wall. They kept running about all night, and trembled
all the while, without knowing which way they went.</span></p>

was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after

perceived her seven daughters killed, and weltering in their blood.</span></p>

out, and, having run over a vast deal of ground, both on this side and that, he
came at last into the very road where the poor children were, and not above a
hundred paces from their father's house. They espied the Ogre, who went at one
step from mountain to mountain, and over rivers as easily as the narrowest
kennels. Little Thumb, seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were,
made his brothers hide themselves in it, and crowded into it himself, minding
always what would become of the Ogre.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Ogre,
who found himself much tired with his long and fruitless journey (for these
boots of seven leagues greatly fatigued the wearer), had a great mind to rest
himself, and, by chance, went to sit down upon the rock where the little boys
had hid themselves. As it was impossible he could be more weary than he was, he
fell asleep, and, after reposing himself some time, began to snore so
frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held
up his great knife and was going to cut their throats. Little Thumb was not so
much frightened as his brothers, and told them that they should run away
immediately toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they
should not be in any pain about him. They took his advice, and got home
presently. Little Thumb came up to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put
them on his own legs. The boots were very long and large, but, as they were
fairies, they had the gift of becoming big and little, according to the legs of
those who wore them; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they
had been made on purpose for him. He went immediately to the Ogre's house,
where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the Ogre's murdered
daughters.</span></p>

husband,&quot; said Little Thumb, &quot;is in very great danger, being taken by
a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his
gold and silver. The very moment they held their daggers at his throat he
perceived me, and desired me to come and tell you the condition he is in, and
that you should give me whatsoever he has of value, without retaining any one
thing; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy; and, as his case is very
pressing, he desired me to make use (you see I have them on) of his boots, that
I might make the more haste and to show you that I do not impose upon you.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The good
woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had: for this Ogre was a very
good husband, though he used to eat up little children. Little Thumb, having
thus got all the Ogre's money, came home to his father's house, where he was
received with abundance of joy.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There are
many people who do not agree in this circumstance, and pretend that Little
Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all, and that he only thought he might very
justly, and with a safe conscience, take off his boots of seven leagues,
because he made no other use of them but to run after little children. These
folks affirm that they are very well assured of this, and the more as having
drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker's house. They aver that when Little
Thumb had taken off the Ogre's boots he went to Court, where he was informed
that they were very much in pain about a certain army, which was two hundred
leagues off, and the success of a battle. He went, say they, to the King, and
told him that, if he desired it, he would bring him news from the army before
night.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The King
promised him a great sum of money upon that condition. Little Thumb was as good
as his word, and returned that very same night with the news; and, this first
expedition causing him to be known, he got whatever he pleased, for the King
paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army. After having for some
time carried on the business of a messenger, and gained thereby great wealth,
he went home to his father, where it was impossible to express the joy they
were all in at his return. He made the whole family very easy, bought places
for his father and brothers, and, by that means, settled them very handsomely
in the world, and, in the meantime, made his court to perfection.</span></p>
