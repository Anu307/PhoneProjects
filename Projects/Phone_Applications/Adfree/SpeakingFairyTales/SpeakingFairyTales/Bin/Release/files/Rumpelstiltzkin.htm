<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe WP Semibold","sans-serif"'>Rumpelstiltzkin</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was once upon a time a poor miller who had
a very beautiful daughter. Now it happened one day that he had an audience with
the King, and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that
he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. &quot;Now that's a talent
worth having,&quot; said the King to the miller; &quot;if your daughter is as
clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and I'll put her to the
test.&quot; When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full of
straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: &quot;Now set to work
and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you haven't spun the
straw into gold you shall die.&quot; Then he closed the door behind him and
left her alone inside.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So the poor miller's daughter sat down, and
didn't know what in the world she was to do. She hadn't the least idea of how
to spin straw into gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry.
Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said:
&quot;Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?&quot;
&quot;Oh!&quot; answered the girl, &quot;I have to spin straw into gold, and
haven't a notion how it's done.&quot; &quot;What will you give me if I spin it
for you?&quot; asked the manikin. &quot;My necklace,&quot; replied the girl.
The little man took the necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir,
whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the bobbin was full. Then he
put on another, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the
second too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw was
spun away, and all the bobbins were full of gold. As soon as the sun rose the
King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and delighted, but
his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal. He had the
miller's daughter put into another room full of straw, much bigger than the first,
and bade her, if she valued her life, spin it all into gold before the
following morning. The girl didn't know what to do, and began to cry; then the
door opened as before, and the tiny little man appeared and said: &quot;What'll
you give me if I spin the straw into gold for you?&quot; &quot;The ring from my
finger,&quot; answered the girl. The manikin took the ring, and whir! round
went the spinning-wheel again, and when morning broke he had spun all the straw
into glittering gold. The King was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his
greed for gold was still not satisfied, and he had the miller's daughter
brought into a yet bigger room full of straw, and said: &quot;You must spin all
this away in the night; but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife.&quot;
&quot;She's only a miller's daughter, it's true,&quot; he thought; &quot;but I
couldn't find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.&quot;
When the girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said:
&quot;What'll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?&quot;
&quot;I've nothing more to give,&quot; answered the girl. &quot;Then promise me
when you are Queen to give me your first child.&quot; &quot;Who knows what may
not happen before that?&quot; thought the miller's daughter; and besides, she
saw no other way out of it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and
he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold. When the King came in
the morning, and found everything as he had desired, he straightway made her
his wife, and the miller's daughter became a queen.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When a year had passed a beautiful son was born
to her, and she thought no more of the little man, till all of a sudden one day
he stepped into her room and said: &quot;Now give me what you promised.&quot;
The Queen was in a great state, and offered the little man all the riches in
her kingdom if he would only leave her the child. But the manikin said:
&quot;No, a living creature is dearer to me than all the treasures in the
world.&quot; Then the Queen began to cry and sob so bitterly that the little
man was sorry for her, and said: &quot;I'll give you three days to guess my
name, and if you find it out in that time you may keep your child.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the Queen pondered the whole night over all
the names she had ever heard, and sent a messenger to scour the land, and to
pick up far and near any names he could come across. When the little man
arrived on the following day she began with Kasper, Melchior, Belshazzar, and
all the other names she knew, in a string, but at each one the manikin called
out: &quot;That's not my name.&quot; The next day she sent to inquire the names
of all the people in the neighborhood, and had a long list of the most uncommon
and extraordinary for the little man when he made his appearance. &quot;Is your
name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks, Spindleshanks?&quot; but he always
replied: &quot;That's not my name.&quot; On the third day the messenger
returned and announced: &quot;I have not been able to find any new names, but
as I came upon a high hill round the corner of the wood, where the foxes and
hares bid each other good-night, I saw a little house, and in front of the
house burned a fire, and round the fire sprang the most grotesque little man,
hopping on one leg and crying:</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;To-morrow I brew, to-day I bake, And then
the child away I'll take; For little deems my royal dame That Rumpelstiltzkin
is my name!&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>You can imagine the Queen's delight at hearing
the name, and when the little man stepped in shortly afterward and asked:
&quot;Now, my lady Queen, what's my name?&quot; she asked first: &quot;Is your
name Conrad?&quot; &quot;NO.&quot; &quot;Is your name Harry?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot; &quot;Is your name perhaps, Rumpelstiltzkin?&quot; &quot;Some
demon has told you that! some demon has told you that!&quot; screamed the
little man, and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it
sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both
hands and tore himself in two.</span></p>
