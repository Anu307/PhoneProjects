History of Jack the Giant-Killer</span></p>

reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack, who
was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing or reading of
conjurers, giants, and fairies; and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the
knights of King Arthur's Round Table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In those
days there lived on St. Michael's Mount, off Cornwall, a huge giant, eighteen
feet high and nine feet round; his fierce and savage looks were the terror of
all who beheld him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He dwelt
in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used to wade over to the
mainland in search of prey; when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his
back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist, and march
back to his own abode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him.</span></p>

8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Jack took
a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern, and one winter's
evening he went to the mount. There he dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and
twenty broad. He covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground.
He then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den
crying out: &quot;You saucy villain! you shall pay for this I'll broil you for
my breakfast!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

just finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong into the pit,
and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him. Jack
then returned home to cheer his friends with the news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Another
giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have
him in his power. This giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely
wood; and some time after the death of Cormoran Jack was passing through a
wood, and being weary, sat down and went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The giant,
passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where he locked him up
in a large room, the floor of which was covered with the bodies, skulls and
bones of men and women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon after
the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant, to take a meal
off his flesh; and Jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two
giants approaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Jack,
perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage, and making a
slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and tied it to the
window- bars; he then pulled till he had choked them. When they were black in
the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Jack next
took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore, and went into the
castle again. He made a strict search through all the rooms, and in one of them
found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads, and almost starved to
death. They told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants, who had
then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh
of their own dead husbands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ladies,&quot;
said Jack, &quot;I have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother; and I
give you this castle and all the riches it contains, to make some amends for
the dreadful pains you have felt.&quot; He then very politely gave them the
keys of the castle, and went further on his journey to Wales.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As Jack
had but little money, he went on as fast as possible. At length he came to a
handsome house. Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh giant.
Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way, on which the giant made him
welcome, and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Jack took
off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could not go to sleep. Soon
after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room,
and saying to himself:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Though
here you lodge with me this night, You shall not see the morning light; My club
shall dash your brains out quite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Say
you so?&quot; thought Jack. &quot;Are these your tricks upon travelers? But I
hope to prove as cunning as you are.&quot; Then, getting out of bed, he groped
about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood. He laid it in
his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The giant,
about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeon struck many blows
on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid the log; and then he went
back to his own room, thinking he had broken all Jack's bones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Early in
the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter, and walked into the giant's
room to thank him for his lodging. The giant started when he saw him, and began
to stammer out: &quot;Oh! dear me; is it you? Pray how did you sleep last
night? Did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Nothing
to speak of,&quot; said Jack, carelessly; &quot;a rat, I believe, gave me three
or four slaps with its tail, and disturbed me a little; but I soon went to
sleep again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The giant
wondered more and more at this; yet he did not answer a word, but went to bring
two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast. Jack wanted to make the
giant believe that he could eat as much as himself, so he contrived to button a
leathern bag inside his coat, and slip the hasty-pudding into this bag, while
he seemed to put it into his mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When
breakfast was over he said to the giant: &quot;Now I will show you a fine
trick. I can cure all wounds with a touch; I could cut off my head in one
minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders. You shall see an
example.&quot; He then took hold of the knife, ripped up the leathern bag, and
all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

splutter hur nails!&quot; cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be outdone
by such a little fellow as Jack, &quot;hur can do that hurself&quot;; so he
snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in a moment dropped
down dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Jack,
having hitherto been successful in all his under- takings, resolved not to be
idle in future; he therefore furnished himself with a horse, a cap of
knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and an invisible coat, the
better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay before him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He
traveled over high hills, and on the third day he came to a large and spacious
forest through which his road lay. Scarcely had he entered the forest when he
beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome
knight and his lady. Jack alighted from his horse, and tying him to an oak
tree, put on his invisible coat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he
came up to the giant he made several strokes at him, but could not reach his
body, but wounded his thighs in several places; and at length, putting both
hands to his sword and aiming with all his might, he cut off both his legs.
Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck, plunged his sword into the giant's
body, when the monster gave a groan and expired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The knight
and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invited him to their
house, to receive a proper reward for his services. &quot;No,&quot; said Jack,
&quot;I cannot be easy till I find out this monster's habitation.&quot; So,
taking the knight's directions, he mounted his horse and soon after came in
sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his
brother's return.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:28.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt;line-height:

alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat, approached and
aimed a blow at the giant's head, but, missing his aim, he only cut off his
nose. On this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

said Jack, &quot;if this be the case I'd better dispatch you!&quot; so, jumping
upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he dropped down dead.</span></p>

proceeded on his journey, and traveled over hills and dales, till arriving at
the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house, when an
old man let him in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

was seated the hermit thus addressed him: &quot;My son, on the top of this
mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the giant Galligantus and a vile
magician. I lament the fate of a duke's daughter, whom they seized as she was
walking in her father's garden, and brought hither transformed into a
deer.&quot;</span></p>

promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he would break the
enchantment; and after a sound sleep he rose early, put on his invisible coat,

had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery griffins, but he passed
between them without the least fear of danger, for they could not see him
because of his invisible coat. On the castle gate he found a golden trumpet,
under which were written these lines:</span></p>

stood biting their thumbs and shaking with fear. Jack, with his sword of
sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was then carried away by a
whirlwind; and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds
and beasts returned to their proper shapes. The castle vanished away like
smoke, and the head of the giant Galligantus was then sent to King Arthur.</span></p>
