<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi
and the ducks</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi is a spider fairy. He wears brown
deerskin leggins with long soft fringes on either side, and tiny beaded
moccasins on his feet. His long black hair is parted in the middle and wrapped
with red, red bands. Each round braid hangs over a small brown ear and falls
forward over his shoulders. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He even paints his funny face with red and
yellow, and draws big black rings around his eyes. He wears a deerskin jacket,
with bright colored beads sewed tightly on it. Iktomi dresses like a real
Dakota brave. In truth, his paint and deerskins are the best part of him—if
ever dress is part of man or fairy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi is a wily fellow. His hands are always
kept in mischief. He prefers to spread a snare rather than to earn the smallest
thing with honest hunting. Why! he laughs outright with wide open mouth when
some simple folk are caught in a trap, sure and fast. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He never dreams another lives so bright as he.
Often his own conceit leads him hard against the common sense of simpler
people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Poor Iktomi cannot help being a little imp. And
so long as he is a naughty fairy, he cannot find a single friend. No one helps
him when he is in trouble. No one really loves him. Those who come to admire
his handsome beaded jacket and long fringed leggins soon go away sick and tired
of his vain, vain words and heartless laughter. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus Iktomi lives alone in a cone-shaped wigwam
upon the plain. One day he sat hungry within his teepee. Suddenly he rushed out,
dragging after him his blanket. Quickly spreading it on the ground, he tore up
dry tall grass with both his hands and tossed it fast into the blanket. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Tying all the four corners together in a knot,
he threw the light bundle of grass over his shoulder. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Snatching up a slender willow stick with his
free left hand, he started off with a hop and a leap. From side to side bounced
the bundle on his back, as he ran light-footed over the uneven ground. Soon he
came to the edge of the great level land. On the hilltop he paused for breath.
With wicked smacks of his dry parched lips, as if tasting some tender meat, he
looked straight into space toward the marshy river bottom. With a thin palm
shading his eyes from the western sun, he peered far away into the lowlands,
munching his own cheeks all the while. &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; grunted he, satisfied
with what he saw. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A group of wild ducks were dancing and feasting
in the marshes. With wings outspread, tip to tip, they moved up and down in a
large circle. Within the ring, around a small drum, sat the chosen singers,
nodding their heads and blinking their eyes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They sang in unison a merry dance-song, and beat
a lively tattoo on the drum. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Following a winding footpath near by, came a
bent figure of a Dakota brave. He bore on his back a very large bundle. With a
willow cane he propped himself up as he staggered along beneath his burden. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho! who is there?&quot; called out a
curious old duck, still bobbing up and down in the circular dance. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hereupon the drummers stretched their necks till
they strangled their song for a look at the stranger passing by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho, Iktomi! Old fellow, pray tell us what
you carry in your blanket. Do not hurry off! Stop! halt!&quot; urged one of the
singers. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Stop! stay! Show us what is in your
blanket!&quot; cried out other voices. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friends, I must not spoil your dance.
Oh, you would not care to see if you only knew what is in my blanket. Sing on!
dance on! I must not show you what I carry on my back,&quot; answered Iktomi,
nudging his own sides with his elbows. This reply broke up the ring entirely.
Now all the ducks crowded about Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We must see what you carry! We must know
what is in your blanket!&quot; they shouted in both his ears. Some even brushed
their wings against the mysterious bundle. Nudging himself again, wily Iktomi
said, &quot;My friends, 't is only a pack of songs I carry in my blanket.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, then let us hear your songs!&quot;
cried the curious ducks. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length Iktomi consented to sing his songs.
With delight all the ducks flapped their wings and cried together, &quot;Hoye!
hoye!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi, with great care, laid down his bundle on
the ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I will build first a round straw house,
for I never sing my songs in the open air,&quot; said he. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Quickly he bent green willow sticks, planting
both ends of each pole into the earth. These he covered thick with reeds and
grasses. Soon the straw hut was ready. One by one the fat ducks waddled in
through a small opening, which was the only entrance way. Beside the door
Iktomi stood smiling, as the ducks, eyeing his bundle of songs, strutted into
the hut. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In a strange low voice Iktomi began his queer
old tunes. All the ducks sat round-eyed in a circle about the mysterious
singer. It was dim in that straw hut, for Iktomi had not forgot to cover up the
small entrance way. All of a sudden his song burst into full voice. As the
startled ducks sat uneasily on the ground, Iktomi changed his tune into a minor
strain. These were the words he sang: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Istokmus wacipo, tuwayatunwanpi kinhan
ista nisasapi kta,&quot; which is, &quot;With eyes closed you must dance. He
who dares to open his eyes, forever red eyes shall have.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Up rose the circle of seated ducks and holding
their wings close against their sides began to dance to the rhythm of Iktomi's
song and drum. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With eyes closed they did dance! Iktomi ceased
to beat his drum. He began to sing louder and faster. He seemed to be moving
about in the center of the ring. No duck dared blink a wink. Each one shut his
eyes very tight and danced even harder. Up and down! Shifting to the right of
them they hopped round and round in that blind dance. It was a difficult dance
for the curious folk. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At length one of the dancers could close his
eyes no longer! It was a Skiska who peeped the least tiny blink at Iktomi
within the center of the circle. &quot;Oh! oh!&quot; squawked he in awful
terror! &quot;Run! fly! Iktomi is twisting your heads and breaking your necks!
Run out and fly! fly!&quot; he cried. Hereupon the ducks opened their eyes.
There beside Iktomi's bundle of songs lay half of their crowd—flat on their backs.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Out they flew through the opening Skiska had
made as he rushed forth with his alarm. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But as they soared high into the blue sky they
cried to one another: &quot;Oh! your eyes are red-red!&quot; &quot;And yours
are red-red!&quot; For the warning words of the magic minor strain had proven
true. &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; laughed Iktomi, untying the four corners of his
blanket, &quot;I shall sit no more hungry within my dwelling.&quot; Homeward he
trudged along with nice fat ducks in his blanket. He left the little straw hut
for the rains and winds to pull down. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Having reached his own teepee on the high level
lands, Iktomi kindled a large fire out of doors. He planted sharp-pointed
sticks around the leaping flames. On each stake he fastened a duck to roast. A
few he buried under the ashes to bake. Disappearing within his teepee, he came
out again with some huge seashells. These were his dishes. Placing one under
each roasting duck, he muttered, &quot;The sweet fat oozing out will taste well
with the hard-cooked breasts.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Heaping more willows upon the fire, Iktomi sat down
on the ground with crossed shins. A long chin between his knees pointed toward
the red flames, while his eyes were on the browning ducks. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Just above his ankles he clasped and unclasped
his long bony fingers. Now and then he sniffed impatiently the savory odor. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The brisk wind which stirred the fire also
played with a squeaky old tree beside Iktomi's wigwam. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From side to side the tree was swaying and
crying in an old man's voice, &quot;Help! I'll break! I'll fall!&quot; Iktomi
shrugged his great shoulders, but did not once take his eyes from the ducks.
The dripping of amber oil into pearly dishes, drop by drop, pleased his hungry
eyes. Still the old tree man called for help. &quot;He! What sound is it that
makes my ear ache!&quot; exclaimed Iktomi, holding a hand on his ear. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He rose and looked around. The squeaking came
from the tree. Then he began climbing the tree to find the disagreeable sound.
He placed his foot right on a cracked limb without seeing it. Just then a whiff
of wind came rushing by and pressed together the broken edges. There in a
strong wooden hand Iktomi's foot was caught. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! my foot is crushed!&quot; he howled
like a coward. In vain he pulled and puffed to free himself. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While sitting a prisoner on the tree he spied,
through his tears, a pack of gray wolves roaming over the level lands. Waving
his hands toward them, he called in his loudest voice, &quot;He! Gray wolves!
Don't you come here! I'm caught fast in the tree so that my duck feast is
getting cold. Don't you come to eat up my meal.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The leader of the pack upon hearing Iktomi's
words turned to his comrades and said: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ah! hear the foolish fellow! He says he
has a duck feast to be eaten! Let us hurry there for our share!&quot; Away
bounded the wolves toward Iktomi's lodge. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From the tree Iktomi watched the hungry wolves
eat up his nicely browned fat ducks. His foot pained him more and more. He
heard them crack the small round bones with their strong long teeth and eat out
the oily marrow. Now severe pains shot up from his foot through his whole body.
&quot;Hin-hin-hin!&quot; sobbed Iktomi. Real tears washed brown streaks across
his red-painted cheeks. Smacking their lips, the wolves began to leave the
place, when Iktomi cried out like a pouting child, &quot;At least you have left
my baking under the ashes!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho! Po!&quot; shouted the mischievous
wolves; &quot;he says more ducks are to be found under the ashes! Come! Let us
have our fill this once!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Running back to the dead fire, they pawed out
the ducks with such rude haste that a cloud of ashes rose like gray smoke over
them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hin-hin-hin!&quot; moaned Iktomi, when the
wolves had scampered off. All too late, the sturdy breeze returned, and,
passing by, pulled apart the broken edges of the tree. Iktomi was released. But
alas! he had no duck feast. </span></p>
