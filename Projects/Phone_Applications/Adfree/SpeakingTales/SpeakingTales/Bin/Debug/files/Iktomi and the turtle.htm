<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iktomi
and the turtle</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The huntsman Patkasa (turtle) stood bent over a
newly slain deer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The red-tipped arrow he drew from the wounded
deer was unlike the arrows in his own quiver. Another's stray shot had killed
the deer. Patkasa had hunted all the morning without so much as spying an
ordinary blackbird. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At last returning homeward, tired and
heavy-hearted that he had no meat for the hungry mouths in his wigwam, he
walked slowly with downcast eyes. Kind ghosts pitied the unhappy hunter and led
him to the newly slain deer, that his children should not cry for food. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When Patkasa stumbled upon the deer in his path,
he exclaimed: &quot;Good spirits have pushed me hither!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus he leaned long over the gift of the
friendly ghosts. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, my friend!&quot; said a voice behind
his ear, and a hand fell on his shoulder. It was not a spirit this time. It was
old Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, Iktomi!&quot; answered Patkasa, still
stooping over the deer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friend, you are a skilled hunter,&quot;
began Iktomi, smiling a thin smile which spread from one ear to the other. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Suddenly raising up his head Patkasa's black
eyes twinkled as he asked: &quot;Oh, you really say so?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my friend, you are a skillful fellow.
Now let us have a little contest. Let us see who can jump over the deer without
touching a hair on his hide,&quot; suggested Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh, I fear I cannot do it!&quot; cried
Patkasa, rubbing his funny, thick palms together. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Have no coward's doubt, Patkasa. I say you
are a skillful fellow who finds nothing hard to do.&quot; With these words
Iktomi led Patkasa a short distance away. In little puffs Patkasa laughed
uneasily. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, you may jump first,&quot; said
Iktomi. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Patkasa, with doubled fists, swung his fat arms
to and fro, all the while biting hard his under lip. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Just before the run and leap Iktomi put in:
&quot;Let the winner have the deer to eat!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was too late now to say no. Patkasa was more
afraid of being called a coward than of losing the deer. &quot;Ho-wo,&quot; he
replied, still working his short arms. At length he started off on the run. So
quick and small were his steps that he seemed to be kicking the ground only.
Then the leap! But Patkasa tripped upon a stick and fell hard against the side
of the deer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;He-he-he!&quot; exclaimed Iktomi,
pretending disappointment that his friend had fallen. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Lifting him to his feet, he said: &quot;Now it
is my turn to try the high jump!&quot; Hardly was the last word spoken than
Iktomi gave a leap high above the deer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The game is mine!&quot; laughed he,
patting the sullen Patkasa on the back. &quot;My friend, watch the deer while I
go to bring my children,&quot; said Iktomi, darting lightly through the tall
grass. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Patkasa was always ready to believe the words of
scheming people and to do the little favors any one asked of him. However, on
this occasion, he did not answer &quot;Yes, my friend.&quot; He realized that
Iktomi's flattering tongue had made him foolish. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He turned up his nose at Iktomi, now almost out
of sight, as much as to say: &quot;Oh, no, Ikto; I do not hear your
words!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Soon there came a murmur of voices. The sound of
laughter grew louder and louder. All of a sudden it became hushed. Old Iktomi
led his young Iktomi brood to the place where he had left the turtle, but it
was vacant. Nowhere was there any sign of Patkasa or the deer. Then the babes
did howl! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Be still!&quot; said father Iktomi to his
children. &quot;I know where Patkasa lives. Follow me. I shall take you to the
turtle's dwelling.&quot; He ran along a narrow footpath toward the creek near
by. Close upon his heels came his children with tear-streaked faces. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;There!&quot; said Iktomi in a loud whisper
as he gathered his little ones on the bank. &quot;There is Patkasa broiling
venison! There is his teepee, and the savory fire is in his front yard!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young Iktomis stretched their necks and
rolled their round black eyes like newly hatched birds. They peered into the
water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Now, I will cool Patkasa's fire. I shall
bring you the broiled venison. Watch closely. When you see the black coals rise
to the surface of the water, clap your hands and shout aloud, for soon after
that sign I shall return to you with some tender meat.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus saying Iktomi plunged into the creek.
Splash! splash! the water leaped upward into spray. Scarcely had it become
leveled and smooth than there bubbled up many black spots. The creek was
seething with the dancing of round black things. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The cooled fire! The coals!&quot; laughed
the brood of Iktomis. Clapping together their little hands, they chased one
another along the edge of the creek. They shouted and hooted with great glee. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ahas!&quot; said a gruff voice across the
water. It was Patkasa. In a large willow tree leaning far over the water he sat
upon a large limb. On the very same branch was a bright burning fire over which
Patkasa broiled the venison. By this time the water was calm again. No more
danced those black spots on its surface, for they were the toes of old Iktomi.
He was drowned. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Iktomi children hurried away from the creek,
crying and calling for their water-dead father. </span></p>
