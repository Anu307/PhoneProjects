<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Iya,
the camp-eater</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>From the tall grass came the voice of a crying
babe. The huntsmen who were passing nigh heard and halted. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The tallest one among them hastened toward the
high grass with long, cautious strides. He waded through the growth of green
with just a head above it all. Suddenly exclaiming &quot;Hunhe!&quot; he
dropped out of sight. In another instant he held up in both his hands a tiny
little baby, wrapped in soft brown buckskins. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh ho, a wood-child!&quot; cried the men,
for they were hunting along the wooded river bottom where this babe was found. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>While the hunters were questioning whether or no
they should carry it home, the wee Indian baby kept up his little howl. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;His voice is strong!&quot; said one. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;At times it sounds like an old man's
voice!&quot; whispered a superstitious fellow, who feared some bad spirit hid
in the small child to cheat them by and by. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Let us take it to our wise
chieftain,&quot; at length they said; and the moment they started toward the camp
ground the strange wood-child ceased to cry. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Beside the chieftain's teepee waited the hunters
while the tall man entered with the child. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How! how!&quot; nodded the kind-faced
chieftain, listening to the queer story. Then rising, he took the infant in his
strong arms; gently he laid the black-eyed babe in his daughter's lap.
&quot;This is to be your little son!&quot; said he, smiling. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, father,&quot; she replied. Pleased
with the child, she smoothed the long black hair fringing his round brown face.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Tell the people that I give a feast and
dance this day for the naming of my daughter's little son,&quot; bade the
chieftain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the meanwhile among the men waiting by the
entrance way, one said in a low voice: &quot;I have heard that bad spirits come
as little children into a camp which they mean to destroy.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No! no! Let us not be overcautious. It
would be cowardly to leave a baby in the wild wood where prowl the hungry
wolves!&quot; answered an elderly man. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The tall man now came out of the chieftain's
teepee. With a word he sent them to their dwellings half running with joy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;A feast! a dance for the naming of the
chieftain's grandchild!&quot; cried he in a loud voice to the village people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What? what?&quot; asked they in great
surprise, holding a hand to the ear to catch the words of the crier. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was a momentary silence among the people
while they listened to the ringing voice of the man walking in the center
ground. Then broke forth a rippling, laughing babble among the cone-shaped
teepees. All were glad to hear of the chieftain's grandson. They were happy to
attend the feast and dance for its naming. With excited fingers they twisted
their hair into glossy braids and painted their cheeks with bright red paint.
To and fro hurried the women, handsome in their gala-day dress. Men in loose
deerskins, with long tinkling metal fringes, strode in small numbers toward the
center of the round camp ground. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Here underneath a temporary shade-house of green
leaves they were to dance and feast. The children in deerskins and paints, just
like their elders, were jolly little men and women. Beside their eager parents
they skipped along toward the green dance house. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Here seated in a large circle, the people were
assembled, the proud chieftain rose with the little baby in his arms. The noisy
hum of voices was hushed. Not a tinkling of a metal fringe broke the silence.
The crier came forward to greet the chieftain, then bent attentively over the
small babe, listening to the words of the chieftain. When he paused the crier
spoke aloud to the people: </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This woodland child is adopted by the
chieftain's eldest daughter. His name is Chaske. He wears the title of the
eldest son. In honor of Chaske the chieftain gives this feast and dance! These
are the words of him you see holding a baby in his arms.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes! Yes! Hinnu! How!&quot; came from the
circle. At once the drummers beat softly and slowly their drum while the chosen
singers hummed together to find the common pitch. The beat of the drum grew
louder and faster. The singers burst forth in a lively tune. Then the drumbeats
subsided and faintly marked the rhythm of the singing. Here and there bounced
up men and women, both young and old. They danced and sang with merry light
hearts. Then came the hour of feasting. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Late into the night the air of the camp ground
was alive with the laughing voices of women and the singing in unison of young
men. Within her father's teepee sat the chieftain's daughter. Proud of her
little one, she watched over him asleep in her lap. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Gradually a deep quiet stole over the camp
ground, as one by one the people fell into pleasant dreams. Now all the village
was still. Alone sat the beautiful young mother watching the babe in her lap,
asleep with a gaping little mouth. Amid the quiet of the night, her ear heard the
far-off hum of many voices. The faint sound of murmuring people was in the air.
Upward she glanced at the smoke hole of the wigwam and saw a bright star
peeping down upon her. &quot;Spirits in the air above?&quot; she wondered. Yet
there was no sign to tell her of their nearness. The fine small sound of voices
grew larger and nearer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Father! rise! I hear the coming of some
tribe. Hostile or friendly—I cannot tell. Rise and see!&quot; whispered the
young woman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my daughter!&quot; answered the
chieftain, springing to his feet. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Though asleep, his ear was ever alert. Thus
rushing out into the open, he listened for strange sounds. With an eagle eye he
scanned the camp ground for some sign. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Returning he said: &quot;My daughter, I hear
nothing and see no sign of evil nigh.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh! the sound of many voices comes up from
the earth about me!&quot; exclaimed the young mother. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Bending low over her babe she gave ear to the
ground. Horrified was she to find the mysterious sound came out of the open
mouth of her sleeping child! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Why so unlike other babes!&quot; she cried
within her heart as she slipped him gently from her lap to the ground.
&quot;Mother, listen and tell me if this child is an evil spirit come to
destroy our camp!&quot; she whispered loud. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Placing an ear close to the open baby mouth, the
chieftain and his wife, each in turn heard the voices of a great camp. The
singing of men and women, the beating of the drum, the rattling of deer-hoofs
strung like bells on a string, these were the sounds they heard. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We must go away,&quot; said the chieftain,
leading them into the night. Out in the open he whispered to the frightened
young woman: &quot;Iya, the camp-eater, has come in the guise of a babe. Had
you gone to sleep, he would have jumped out into his own shape and would have
devoured our camp. He is a giant with spindling legs. He cannot fight, for he
cannot run. He is powerful only in the night with his tricks. We are safe as
soon as day breaks.&quot; Then moving closer to the woman, he whispered:
&quot;If he wakes now, he will swallow the whole tribe with one hideous gulp!
Come, we must flee with our people.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus creeping from teepee to teepee a secret
alarm signal was given. At midnight the teepees were gone and there was left no
sign of the village save heaps of dead ashes. So quietly had the people folded
their wigwams and bundled their tent poles that they slipped away unheard by
the sleeping Iya babe. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the morning sun arose, the babe awoke.
Seeing himself deserted, he threw off his baby form in a hot rage. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Wearing his own ugly shape, his huge body
toppled to and fro, from side to side, on a pair of thin legs far too small for
their burden. Though with every move he came dangerously nigh to falling, he
followed in the trail of the fleeing people. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I shall eat you in the sight of a noon-day
sun!&quot; cried Iya in his vain rage, when he spied them encamped beyond a
river. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>By some unknown cunning he swam the river and
sought his way toward the teepees. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hin! hin!&quot; he grunted and growled.
With perspiration beading his brow he strove to wiggle his slender legs beneath
his giant form. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; laughed all the village
people to see Iya made foolish with anger. &quot;Such spindle legs cannot stand
to fight by daylight!&quot; shouted the brave ones who were terror-struck the
night before by the name &quot;Iya.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Warriors with long knives rushed forth and slew
the camp-eater. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Lo! there rose out of the giant a whole Indian
tribe: their camp ground, their teepees in a large circle, and the people
laughing and dancing. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;We are glad to be free!&quot; said these
strange people. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia","serif"'>Thus Iya was killed; and no more are the camp grounds in
danger of being swallowed up in a single night time.</span></p>
