<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Manstin,
the rabbit</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Manstin was an adventurous brave, but very
kind-hearted. Stamping a moccasined foot as he drew on his buckskin leggins, he
said: &quot;Grandmother, beware of Iktomi! Do not let him lure you into some
cunning trap. I am going to the North country on a long hunt.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With these words of caution to the bent old
rabbit grandmother with whom he had lived since he was a tiny babe, Manstin
started off toward the north. He was scarce over the great high hills when he
heard the shrieking of a human child. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Wan!&quot; he ejaculated, pointing his
long ears toward the direction of the sound; &quot;Wan! that is the work of
cruel Double-Face. Shameless coward! he delights in torturing helpless
creatures!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Muttering indistinct words, Manstin ran up the
last hill and lo! in the ravine beyond stood the terrible monster with a face
in front and one in the back of his head! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>This brown giant was without clothes save for a
wild-cat-skin about his loins. With a wicked gleaming eye, he watched the
little black-haired baby he held in his strong arm. In a laughing voice he
hummed an Indian mother's lullaby, &quot;A-boo! Aboo!&quot; and at the same
time he switched the naked baby with a thorny wild-rose bush. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Quickly Manstin jumped behind a large sage bush
on the brow of the hill. He bent his bow and the sinewy string twanged. Now an
arrow stuck above the ear of Double-Face. It was a poisoned arrow, and the
giant fell dead. Then Manstin took the little brown baby and hurried away from
the ravine. Soon he came to a teepee from whence loud wailing voices broke. It
was the teepee of the stolen baby and the mourners were its heart-broken
parents. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When gallant Manstin returned the child to the
eager arms of the mother there came a sudden terror into the eyes of both the
Dakotas. They feared lest it was Double-Face come in a new guise to torture
them. The rabbit understood their fear and said: &quot;I am Manstin, the
kind-hearted,—Manstin, the noted huntsman. I am your friend. Do not fear.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That night a strange thing happened. While the
father and mother slept, Manstin took the wee baby. With his feet placed gently
yet firmly upon the tiny toes of the little child, he drew upward by each small
hand the sleeping child till he was a full-grown man. With a forefinger he
traced a slit in the upper lip; and when on the morrow the man and woman awoke
they could not distinguish their own son from Manstin, so much alike were the
braves. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Henceforth we are friends, to help each
other,&quot; said Manstin, shaking a right hand in farewell. &quot;The earth is
our common ear, to carry from its uttermost extremes one's slightest wish for
the other!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Ho! Be it so!&quot; answered the newly
made man. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Upon leaving his friend, Manstin hurried away
toward the North country whither he was bound for a long hunt. Suddenly he came
upon the edge of a wide brook. His alert eye caught sight of a rawhide rope
staked to the water's brink, which led away toward a small round hut in the
distance. The ground was trodden into a deep groove beneath the loosely drawn
rawhide rope. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hun-he!&quot; exclaimed Manstin, bending
over the freshly made footprints in the moist bank of the brook. &quot;A man's
footprints!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;A blind man lives in yonder hut!
This rope is his guide by which he comes for his daily water!&quot; surmised
Manstin, who knew all the peculiar contrivances of the people. At once his eyes
became fixed upon the solitary dwelling and hither he followed his curiosity,—a
real blind man's rope. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Quietly he lifted the door-flap and entered in.
An old toothless grandfather, blind and shaky with age, sat upon the ground. He
was not deaf however. He heard the entrance and felt the presence of some
stranger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How, grandchild,&quot; he mumbled, for he
was old enough to be grandparent to every living thing, &quot;how! I cannot see
you. Pray, speak your name!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandfather, I am Manstin,&quot; answered
the rabbit, all the while looking with curious eyes about the wigwam. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandfather, what is it so tightly packed
in all these buckskin bags placed against the tent poles?&quot; he asked. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My grandchild, those are dried buffalo
meat and venison. These are magic bags which never grow empty. I am blind and
cannot go on a hunt. Hence a kind Maker has given me these magic bags of
choicest foods.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then the old, bent man pulled at a rope which
lay by his right hand. &quot;This leads me to the brook where I drink! and
this,&quot; said he, turning to the one on his left, &quot;and this takes me
into the forest, where I feel about for dry sticks for my fire.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandfather, I wish I lived in such sure
luxury! I would lean back against a tent pole, and with crossed feet I would
smoke sweet willow bark the rest of my days,&quot; sighed Manstin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My grandchild, your eyes are your luxury!
you would be unhappy without them!&quot; the old man replied. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Grandfather, I would give you my two eyes
for your place!&quot; cried Manstin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;How! you have said it. Arise. Take out
your eyes and give them to me. Henceforth you are at home here in my
stead.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At once Manstin took out both his eyes and the
old man put them on! Rejoicing, the old grandfather started away with his young
eyes while the blind rabbit filled his dream pipe, leaning lazily against the
tent pole. For a short time it was a most pleasant pastime to smoke willow bark
and to eat from the magic bags. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Manstin grew thirsty, but there was no water in
the small dwelling. Taking one of the rawhide ropes he started toward the brook
to quench his thirst. He was young and unwilling to trudge slowly in the old
man's footpath. He was full of glee, for it had been many long moons since he
had tasted such good food. Thus he skipped confidently along jerking the old
weather-eaten rawhide spasmodically till all of a sudden it gave way and
Manstin fell headlong into the water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;En! En!&quot; he grunted kicking
frantically amid stream. All along the slippery bank he vainly tried to climb,
till at last he chanced upon the old stake and the deeply worn footpath.
Exhausted and inwardly disgusted with his mishaps, he crawled more cautiously
on all fours to his wigwam door. Dripping with his recent plunge he sat with
chattering teeth within his unfired wigwam. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sun had set and the night air was chilly, but
there was no fire-wood in the dwelling. &quot;Hin!&quot; murmured Manstin and
bravely tried the other rope. &quot;I go for some fire-wood!&quot; he said,
following the rawhide rope which led into the forest. Soon he stumbled upon
thickly strewn dry willow sticks. Eagerly with both hands he gathered the wood
into his outspread blanket. Manstin was naturally an energetic fellow. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When he had a large heap, he tied two opposite
ends of blanket together and lifted the bundle of wood upon his back, but alas!
he had unconsciously dropped the end of the rope and now he was lost in the
wood! </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Hin! hin!&quot; he groaned. Then pausing a
moment, he set his fan-like ears to catch any sound of approaching footsteps.
There was none. Not even a night bird twittered to help him out of his predicament.
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>With a bold face, he made a start at random. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He fell into some tangled wood where he was held
fast. Manstin let go his bundle and began to lament having given away his two
eyes. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Friend, my friend, I have need of you! The
old oak tree grandfather has gone off with my eyes and I am lost in the
woods!&quot; he cried with his lips close to the earth. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarcely had he spoken when the sound of voices
was audible on the outer edge of the forest. Nearer and louder grew the
voices—one was the clear flute tones of a young brave and the other the
tremulous squeaks of an old grandfather. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It was Manstin's friend with the Earth Ear and
the old grandfather. &quot;Here Manstin, take back your eyes,&quot; said the
old man, &quot;I knew you would not be content in my stead, but I wanted you to
learn your lesson. I have had pleasure seeing with your eyes and trying your
bow and arrows, but since I am old and feeble I much prefer my own teepee and
my magic bags!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Thus talking the three returned to the hut. The
old grandfather crept into his wigwam, which is often mistaken for a mere oak
tree by little Indian girls and boys. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Manstin, with his own bright eyes fitted into
his head again, went on happily to hunt in the North country. </span></p>
