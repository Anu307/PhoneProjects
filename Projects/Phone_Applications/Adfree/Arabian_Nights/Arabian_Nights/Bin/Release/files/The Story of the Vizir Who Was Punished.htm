<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Vizir Who Was
Punished</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was once upon a time a king who had a son
who was very fond of hunting. He often allowed him to indulge in this pastime,
but he had ordered his grand-vizir always to go with him, and never to lose
sight of him. One day the huntsman roused a stag, and the prince, thinking that
the vizir was behind, gave chase, and rode so hard that he found himself alone.
He stopped, and having lost sight of it, he turned to rejoin the vizir, who had
not been careful enough to follow him. But he lost his way. Whilst he was
trying to find it, he saw on the side of the road a beautiful lady who was
crying bitterly. He drew his horse's rein, and asked her who she was and what
she was doing in this place, and if she needed help. &quot;I am the daughter of
an Indian king,&quot; she answered, &quot;and whilst riding in the country I
fell asleep and tumbled off. My horse has run away, and I do not know what has
become of him.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The young prince had pity on her, and offered to
take her behind him, which he did. As they passed by a ruined building the lady
dismounted and went in. The prince also dismounted and followed her. To his
great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside, &quot;Rejoice my
children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth.&quot; And other voices replied,
&quot;Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at once, as we are very
hungry?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince at once saw the danger he was in. He
now knew that the lady who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an
ogress, who lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles surprised and
devoured passers-by. He was terrified, and threw himself on his horse. The
pretended princess appeared at this moment, and seeing that she had lost her
prey, she said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid. What do you want?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am lost,&quot; he answered, &quot;and I
am looking for the road.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Keep straight on,&quot; said the ogress,
&quot;and you will find it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The prince could hardly believe his ears, and
rode off as hard as he could. He found his way, and arrived safe and sound at
his father's house, where he told him of the danger he had run because of the
grand-vizir's carelessness. The king was very angry, and had him strangled
immediately. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; went on the vizir to the Greek
king, &quot;to return to the physician, Douban. If you do not take care, you
will repent of having trusted him. Who knows what this remedy, with which he
has cured you, may not in time have a bad effect on you?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Greek king was naturally very weak, and did
not perceive the wicked intention of his vizir, nor was he firm enough to keep
to his first resolution. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Well, vizir,&quot; he said, &quot;you are
right. Perhaps he did come to take my life. He might do it by the mere smell of
one of his drugs. I must see what can be done.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;The best means, sire, to put your life in
security, is to send for him at once, and to cut off his head directly he
comes,&quot; said the vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I really think,&quot; replied the king,
&quot;that will be the best way.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He then ordered one of his ministers to fetch
the physician, who came at once. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have had you sent for,&quot; said the
king, &quot;in order to free myself from you by taking your life.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The physician was beyond measure astonished when
he heard he was to die. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What crimes have I committed, your
majesty?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I have learnt,&quot; replied the king,
&quot;that you are a spy, and intend to kill me. But I will be first, and kill
you. Strike,&quot; he added to an executioner who was by, &quot;and rid me of
this assassin.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this cruel order the physician threw himself
on his knees. &quot;Spare my life,&quot; he cried, &quot;and yours will be
spared.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman stopped here to say to the genius:
&quot;You see what passed between the Greek king and the physician has just
passed between us two. The Greek king,&quot; he went on, &quot;had no mercy on
him, and the executioner bound his eyes.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>All those present begged for his life, but in
vain. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The physician on his knees, and bound, said to
the king: &quot;At least let me put my affairs in order, and leave my books to
persons who will make good use of them. There is one which I should like to
present to your majesty. It is very precious, and ought to be kept carefully in
your treasury. It contains many curious things the chief being that when you
cut off my head, if your majesty will turn to the sixth leaf, and read the
third line of the left-hand page, my head will answer all the questions you
like to ask it.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king, eager to see such a wonderful thing,
put off his execution to the next day, and sent him under a strong guard to his
house. There the physician put his affairs in order, and the next day there was
a great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death, and the doings after it.
The physician went up to the foot of the throne with a large book in his hand.
He carried a basin, on which he spread the covering of the book, and presenting
it to the king, said: &quot;Sire, take this book, and when my head is cut off,
let it be placed in the basin on the covering of this book; as soon as it is
there, the blood will cease to flow. Then open the book, and my head will
answer your questions. But, sire, I implore your mercy, for I am
innocent.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Your prayers are useless, and if it were
only to hear your head speak when you are dead, you should die.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying, he took the book from the physician's
hands, and ordered the executioner to do his duty. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The head was so cleverly cut off that it fell
into the basin, and directly the blood ceased to flow. Then, to the great
astonishment of the king, the eyes opened, and the head said, &quot;Your
majesty, open the book.&quot; The king did so, and finding that the first leaf
stuck against the second, he put his finger in his mouth, to turn it more
easily. He did the same thing till he reached the sixth page, and not seeing
any writing on it, &quot;Physician,&quot; he said, &quot;there is no
writing.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Turn over a few more pages,&quot; answered
the head. The king went on turning, still putting his finger in his mouth, till
the poison in which each page was dipped took effect. His sight failed him, and
he fell at the foot of his throne. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the physician's head saw that the poison had
taken effect, and that the king had only a few more minutes to live,
&quot;Tyrant,&quot; it cried, &quot;see how cruelty and injustice are
punished.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Scarcely had it uttered these words than the
king died, and the head lost also the little life that had remained in it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That is the end of the story of the Greek king,
and now let us return to the fisherman and the genius. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If the Greek king,&quot; said the
fisherman, &quot;had spared the physician, he would not have thus died. The
same thing applies to you. Now I am going to throw you into the sea.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My friend,&quot; said the genius, &quot;do
not do such a cruel thing. Do not treat me as Imma treated Ateca.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What did Imma do to Ateca?&quot; asked the
fisherman. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you think I can tell you while I am
shut up in here?&quot; replied the genius. &quot;Let me out, and I will make
you rich.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The hope of being no longer poor made the
fisherman give way. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you will give me your promise to do
this, I will open the lid. I do not think you will dare to break your
word.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The genius promised, and the fisherman lifted
the lid. He came out at once in smoke, and then, having resumed his proper
form, the first thing he did was to kick the vase into the sea. This frightened
the fisherman, but the genius laughed and said, &quot;Do not be afraid; I only
did it to frighten you, and to show you that I intend to keep my word; take
your nets and follow me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He began to walk in front of the fisherman, who
followed him with some misgivings. They passed in front of the town, and went
up a mountain and then down into a great plain, where there was a large lake
lying between four hills. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they reached the lake the genius said to
the fisherman, &quot;Throw your nets and catch fish.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman did as he was told, hoping for a
good catch, as he saw plenty of fish. What was his astonishment at seeing that
there were four quite different kinds, some white, some red, some blue, and
some yellow. He caught four, one of each colour. As he had never seen any like
them he admired them very much, and he was very pleased to think how much money
he would get for them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Take these fish and carry them to the
Sultan, who will give you more money for them than you have ever had in your
life. You can come every day to fish in this lake, but be careful not to throw
your nets more than once every day, otherwise some harm will happen to you. If
you follow my advice carefully you will find it good.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Saying these words, he struck his foot against
the ground, which opened, and when he had disappeared, it closed immediately. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman resolved to obey the genius
exactly, so he did not cast his nets a second time, but walked into the town to
sell his fish at the palace. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the Sultan saw the fish he was much
astonished. He looked at them one after the other, and when he had admired them
long enough, &quot;Take these fish,&quot; he said to his first vizir, &quot;and
given them to the clever cook the Emperor of the Greeks sent me. I think they
must be as good as they are beautiful.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The vizir took them himself to the cook, saying,
&quot;Here are four fish that have been brought to the Sultan. He wants you to
cook them.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he went back to the Sultan, who told him to
give the fisherman four hundred gold pieces. The fisherman, who had never
before possessed such a large sum of money at once, could hardly believe his good
fortune. He at once relieved the needs of his family, and made good use of it. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>But now we must return to the kitchen, which we
shall find in great confusion. The cook, when she had cleaned the fish, put
them in a pan with some oil to fry them. When she thought them cooked enough on
one side she turned them on the other. But scarcely had she done so when the
walls of the kitchen opened, and there came out a young and beautiful damsel.
She was dressed in an Egyptian dress of flowered satin, and she wore earrings,
and a necklace of white pearls, and bracelets of gold set with rubies, and she
held a wand of myrtle in her hand. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>She went up to the pan, to the great
astonishment of the cook, who stood motionless at the sight of her. She struck
one of the fish with her rod, &quot;Fish, fish,&quot; said she, &quot;are you
doing your duty?&quot; The fish answered nothing, and then she repeated her
question, whereupon they all raised their heads together and answered very
distinctly, &quot;Yes, yes. If you reckon, we reckon. If you pay your debts, we
pay ours. If you fly, we conquer, and we are content.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When they had spoken the girl upset the pan, and
entered the opening in the wall, which at once closed, and appeared the same as
before. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When the cook had recovered from her fright she lifted
up the fish which had fallen into the ashes, but she found them as black as
cinders, and not fit to serve up to the Sultan. She began to cry. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Alas! what shall I say to the Sultan? He
will be so angry with me, and I know he will not believe me!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Whilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in
and asked if the fish were ready. She told him all that had happened, and he
was much surprised. He sent at once for the fisherman, and when he came said to
him, &quot;Fisherman, bring me four more fish like you have brought already,
for an accident has happened to them so that they cannot be served up to the
Sultan.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The fisherman did not say what the genius had
told him, but he excused himself from bringing them that day on account of the
length of the way, and he promised to bring them next day. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the night he went to the lake, cast his nets,
and on drawing them in found four fish, which were like the others, each of a
different colour. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He went back at once and carried them to the
grand-vizir as he had promised. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He then took them to the kitchen and shut
himself up with the cook, who began to cook them as she had done the four
others on the previous day. When she was about to turn them on the other side,
the wall opened, the damsel appeared, addressed the same words to the fish,
received the same answer, and then overturned the pan and disappeared. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir was filled with astonishment.
&quot;I shall tell the Sultan all that has happened,&quot; said he. And he did
so. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was very much astounded, and wished
to see this marvel for himself. So he sent for the fisherman, and asked him to
procure four more fish. The fisherman asked for three days, which were granted,
and he then cast his nets in the lake, and again caught four different coloured
fish. The sultan was delighted to see he had got them, and gave him again four
hundred gold pieces. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as the Sultan had the fish he had them
carried to his room with all that was needed to cook them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Then he shut himself up with the grand-vizir,
who began to prepare them and cook them. When they were done on one side he
turned them over on the other. Then the wall of the room opened, but instead of
the maiden a black slave came out. He was enormously tall, and carried a large
green stick with which he touched the fish, saying in a terrible voice,
&quot;Fish, fish, are you doing your duty?&quot; To these words the fish
lifting up their heads replied, &quot;Yes, yes. If you reckon, we reckon. If
you pay your debts, we pay ours. If you fly, we conquer, and are content.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The black slave overturned the pan in the middle
of the room, and the fish were turned to cinders. Then he stepped proudly back
into the wall, which closed round him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;After having seen this,&quot; said the
Sultan, &quot;I cannot rest. These fish signify some mystery I must clear
up.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He sent for the fisherman.
&quot;Fisherman,&quot; he said, &quot;the fish you have brought us have caused
me some anxiety. Where did you get them from?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; he answered, &quot;I got them
from a lake which lies in the middle of four hills beyond yonder mountains.&quot;
</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Do you know this lake?&quot; asked the
Sultan of the grand-vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;No; though I have hunted many times round
that mountain, I have never heard of it,&quot; said the vizir. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As the fisherman said it was only three hours'
journey away, the sultan ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither, and
the fisherman led them. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>They climbed the mountain, and then, on the
other side, saw the lake as the fisherman had described. The water was so clear
that they could see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it. They looked at
them for some time, and then the Sultan ordered them to make a camp by the edge
of the water. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>When night came the Sultan called his vizir, and
said to him, &quot;I have resolved to clear up this mystery. I am going out
alone, and do you stay here in my tent, and when my ministers come to-morrow,
say I am not well, and cannot see them. Do this each day till I return.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The grand-vizir tried to persuade the Sultan not
to go, but in vain. The Sultan took off his state robe and put on his sword,
and when he saw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He climbed one of the hills, and then crossed
the great plain, till, just as the sun rose, he beheld far in front of him a
large building. When he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace of
beautiful black polished marble, covered with steel as smooth as a mirror. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He went to the gate, which stood half open, and
went in, as nobody came when he knocked. He passed through a magnificent
courtyard and still saw no one, though he called aloud several times. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He entered large halls where the carpets were of
silk, the lounges and sofas covered with tapestry from Mecca, and the hangings
of the most beautiful Indian stuffs of gold and silver. Then he found himself
in a splendid room, with a fountain supported by golden lions. The water out of
the lions' mouths turned into diamonds and pearls, and the leaping water almost
touched a most beautifully-painted dome. The palace was surrounded on three
sides by magnificent gardens, little lakes, and woods. Birds sang in the trees,
which were netted over to keep them always there. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Still the Sultan saw no one, till he heard a
plaintive cry, and a voice which said, &quot;Oh that I could die, for I am too
unhappy to wish to live any longer!&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan looked round to discover who it was
who thus bemoaned his fate, and at last saw a handsome young man, richly
clothed, who was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground. His face
was very sad. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The sultan approached him and bowed to him. The
young man bent his head very low, but did not rise. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; he said to the Sultan, &quot;I
cannot rise and do you the reverence that I am sure should be paid to your
rank.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sir,&quot; answered the Sultan, &quot;I am
sure you have a good reason for not doing so, and having heard your cry of
distress, I am come to offer you my help. Whose is this palace, and why is it
thus empty?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Instead of answering the young man lifted up his
robe, and showed the Sultan that, from the waist downwards, he was a block of
black marble. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Sultan was horrified, and begged the young
man to tell him his story. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Willingly I will tell you my sad
history,&quot; said the young man. </span></p>
