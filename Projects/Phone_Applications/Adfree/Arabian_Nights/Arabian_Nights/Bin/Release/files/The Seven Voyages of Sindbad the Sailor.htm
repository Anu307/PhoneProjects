<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Seven Voyages of Sindbad the
Sailor</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid
there lived in Bagdad a poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was
sent to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other. Before he had
accomplished half the distance he was so tired that, finding himself in a quiet
street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose water, and a cool breeze was
blowing, he set his burden upon the ground, and sat down to rest in the shade
of a grand house. Very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a
pleasanter place; a delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from the
open windows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamed up from
the hot pavement. Within the palace he heard some music, as of many instruments
cunningly played, and the melodious warble of nightingales and other birds, and
by this, and the appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he presently
became aware, he judged that feasting and merry making were going on. He
wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had never seen before,
the street in which it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass. To
satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed servants who stood
at the door, and asked one of them the name of the master of the mansion. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What,&quot; replied he, &quot;do you live
in Bagdad, and not know that here lives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that
famous traveller who sailed over every sea upon which the sun shines?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The porter, who had often heard people speak of
the immense wealth of Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot
seemed to be as happy as his own was miserable. Casting his eyes up to the sky
he exclaimed aloud, </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Consider, Mighty Creator of all things,
the differences between Sindbad's life and mine. Every day I suffer a thousand
hardships and misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley
bread to keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad spends money
right and left and lives upon the fat of the land! What has he done that you
should give him this pleasant life--what have I done to deserve so hard a
fate?&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>So saying he stamped upon the ground like one
beside himself with misery and despair. Just at this moment a servant came out
of the palace, and taking him by the arm said, &quot;Come with me, the noble
Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Hindbad was not a little surprised at this
summons, and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the
displeasure of Sindbad, so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he
could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street.
However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of, and urged him
to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to yield. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He followed the servant into a vast room, where
a great company was seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies.
In the place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white beard gave him a
venerable air. Behind his chair stood a crowd of attendants eager to minister
to his wants. This was the famous Sindbad himself. The porter, more than ever
alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence, tremblingly saluted the noble
company. Sindbad, making a sign to him to approach, caused him to be seated at
his right hand, and himself heaped choice morsels upon his plate, and poured
out for him a draught of excellent wine, and presently, when the banquet drew
to a close, spoke to him familiarly, asking his name and occupation. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;My lord,&quot; replied the porter, &quot;I
am called Hindbad.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am glad to see you here,&quot; continued
Sindbad. &quot;And I will answer for the rest of the company that they are
equally pleased, but I wish you to tell me what it was that you said just now
in the street.&quot; For Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast
began, had heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At this question Hindbad was covered with
confusion, and hanging down his head, replied, &quot;My lord, I confess that,
overcome by weariness and ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray
you to pardon me.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Oh!&quot; replied Sindbad, &quot;do not
imagine that I am so unjust as to blame you. On the contrary, I understand your
situation and can pity you. Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish
to set you right. You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and
luxury that you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is far
indeed from being the case. I have only reached this happy state after having
for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Yes, my noble friends,&quot; he continued,
addressing the company, &quot;I assure you that my adventures have been strange
enough to deter even the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing
the seas. Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven
voyages, and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and land, I
will now give you a full and true account of them, which I think you will be
well pleased to hear.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As Sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly
on account of the porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the
burden which had been left in the street should be carried by some of his own
servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first, while he remained
to listen to the story. </span></p>
