<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Story of the Greek King and the
Physician Douban</span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In the country of Zouman, in Persia, there lived
a Greek king. This king was a leper, and all his doctors had been unable to
cure him, when a very clever physician came to his court. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He was very learned in all languages, and knew a
great deal about herbs and medicines. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>As soon as he was told of the king's illness he
put on his best robe and presented himself before the king. &quot;Sire,&quot;
said he, &quot;I know that no physician has been able to cure your majesty, but
if you will follow my instructions, I will promise to cure you without any
medicines or outward application.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king listened to this proposal. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;If you are clever enough to do this,&quot;
he said, &quot;I promise to make you and your descendants rich for ever.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The physician went to his house and made a polo
club, the handle of which he hollowed out, and put in it the drug he wished to
use. Then he made a ball, and with these things he went the next day to the
king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>He told him that he wished him to play at polo.
Accordingly the king mounted his horse and went into the place where he played.
There the physician approached him with the bat he had made, saying, &quot;Take
this, sire, and strike the ball till you feel your hand and whole body in a glow.
When the remedy that is in the handle of the club is warmed by your hand it
will penetrate throughout your body. The you must return to your palace, bathe,
and go to sleep, and when you awake to-morrow morning you will be cured.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The king took the club and urged his horse after
the ball which he had thrown. He struck it, and then it was hit back by the
courtiers who were playing with him. When he felt very hot he stopped playing,
and went back to the palace, went into the bath, and did all that the physician
had said. The next day when he arose he found, to his great joy and
astonishment, that he was completely cured. When he entered his
audience-chamber all his courtiers, who were eager to see if the wonderful cure
had been effected, were overwhelmed with joy. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The physician Douban entered the hall and bowed
low to the ground. The king, seeing him, called him, made him sit by his side,
and showed him every mark of honour. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>That evening he gave him a long and rich robe of
state, and presented him with two thousand sequins. The following day he
continued to load him with favours. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Now the king had a grand-vizir who was
avaricious, and envious, and a very bad man. He grew extremely jealous of the
physician, and determined to bring about his ruin. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>In order to do this he asked to speak in private
with the king, saying that he had a most important communication to make. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked the king. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the grand-vizir,
&quot;it is most dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose faithfulness
is not proved, You do not know that this physician is not a traitor come here
to assassinate you.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;I am sure,&quot; said the king, &quot;that
this man is the most faithful and virtuous of men. If he wished to take my
life, why did he cure me? Cease to speak against him. I see what it is, you are
jealous of him; but do not think that I can be turned against him. I remember
well what a vizir said to King Sindbad, his master, to prevent him from putting
the prince, his son, to death.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>What the Greek king said excited the vizir's
curiosity, and he said to him, &quot;Sire, I beg your majesty to have the
condescension to tell me what the vizir said to King Sindbad.&quot; </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.25pt'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>&quot;This vizir,&quot; he replied, &quot;told
King Sindbad that one ought not believe everything that a mother-in-law says,
and told him this story.&quot; </span></p>
