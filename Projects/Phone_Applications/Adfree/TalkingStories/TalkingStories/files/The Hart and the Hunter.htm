<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Hart was once drinking from a pool and
admiring the noble figure he made there. &quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;where
can you see such noble horns as these, with such antlers! I wish I had legs
more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and
slight.&quot; At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling
after him. Away bounded the Hart, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was
nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed
under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were
caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up. &quot;Alas! alas!&quot; cried
the Hart: &quot;We often despise what is most useful to us.&quot;</span></p>
