<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body
that they were doing all the work and the Belly was having all the food. So
they held a meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to strike work till
the Belly consented to take its proper share of the work. So for a day or two,
the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receive it, and the
Teeth had no work to do. But after a day or two the Members began to find that
they themselves were not in a very active condition: the Hands could hardly
move, and the Mouth was all parched and dry, while the Legs were unable to
support the rest. So thus they found that even the Belly in its dull quiet way
was doing necessary work for the Body, and that all must work together or the
Body will go to pieces.</span></p>
