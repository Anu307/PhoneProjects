<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>It happened that a Countryman was sowing some
hemp seeds in a field where a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about
picking up their food. &quot;Beware of that man,&quot; quoth the Swallow.
&quot;Why, what is he doing?&quot; said the others. &quot;That is hemp seed he
is sowing; be careful to pick up every one of the seeds, or else you will
repent it.&quot; The birds paid no heed to the Swallow's words, and by and by
the hemp grew up and was made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and
many a bird that had despised the Swallow's advice was caught in nets made out
of that very hemp. &quot;What did I tell you?&quot; said the Swallow. Destroy
the seed of evil, or it will grow up to your ruin.</span></p>
