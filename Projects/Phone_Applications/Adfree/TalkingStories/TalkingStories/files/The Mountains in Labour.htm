<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One day the Countrymen noticed that the
Mountains were in labour; smoke came out of their summits, the earth was
quaking at their feet, trees were crashing, and huge rocks were tumbling. They
felt sure that something horrible was going to happen. They all gathered
together in one place to see what terrible thing this could be. They waited and
they waited, but nothing came. At last there was a still more violent
earthquake, and a huge gap appeared in the side of the Mountains. They all fell
down upon their knees and waited. At last, and at last, a teeny, tiny mouse
poked its little head and bristles out of the gap and came running down towards
them, and ever after they used to say: &quot;Much outcry, little outcome.&quot;</span></p>
