<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he
happened to meet a House-dog who was passing by. &quot;Ah, Cousin,&quot; said
the Dog. &quot;I knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the
ruin of you. Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly
given to you?&quot; &quot;I would have no objection,&quot; said the Wolf,
&quot;if I could only get a place.&quot; &quot;I will easily arrange that for
you,&quot; said the Dog; &quot;come with me to my master and you shall share my
work.&quot; So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together. On the way
there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the Dog's neck was
very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about. &quot;Oh, it is
nothing,&quot; said the Dog. &quot;That is only the place where the collar is put
on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to
it.&quot; &quot;Is that all?&quot; said the Wolf. &quot;Then good-bye to you,
Master Dog.&quot; Better starve free than be a fat slave.</span></p>
