font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>An Ass once found a Lion's skin which the
hunters had left out in the sun to dry. He put it on and went towards his
native village. All fled at his approach, both men and animals, and he was a
proud Ass that day. In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed, but then
every one knew him, and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for
the fright he had caused. And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said:
&quot;Ah, I knew you by your voice.&quot; Fine clothes may disguise, but silly
words will disclose a fool.</span></p>
