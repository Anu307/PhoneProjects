font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a
farmer's hen-coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. &quot;Good
news, good news!&quot; he cried. &quot;Why, what is that?&quot; said the Cock.
&quot;King Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may hurt a bird
henceforth, but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship.&quot;
&quot;Why, that is good news,&quot; said the Cock; &quot;and there I see some
one coming, with whom we can share the good tidings.&quot; And so saying he
craned his neck forward and looked afar off. &quot;What is it you see?&quot;
said the Fox. &quot;It is only my master's Dog that is coming towards us. What,
going so soon?&quot; he continued, as the Fox began to turn away as soon as he
had heard the news. &quot;Will you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the
reign of universal peace?&quot; &quot;I would gladly do so,&quot; said the Fox,
&quot;but I fear he may not have heard of King Lion's decree.&quot; Cunning
often outwits itself.</span></p>
