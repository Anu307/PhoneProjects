<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Wolf had been gorging on an animal he had
killed, when suddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could
not swallow it. He soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and ran up and down
groaning and groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain. He tried
to induce every one he met to remove the bone. &quot;I would give
anything,&quot; said he, &quot;if you would take it out.&quot; At last the
Crane agreed to try, and told the Wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws as
wide as he could. Then the Crane put its long neck down the Wolf's throat, and
with its beak loosened the bone, till at last it got it out. &quot;Will you
kindly give me the reward you promised?&quot; said the Crane. The Wolf grinned
and showed his teeth and said: &quot;Be content. You have put your head inside
a Wolf's mouth and taken it out again in safety; that ought to be reward enough
for you.&quot; Gratitude and greed go not together.</span></p>
