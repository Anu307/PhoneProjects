<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A slave named Androcles once escaped from his
master and fled to the forest. As he was wandering about there he came upon a
Lion lying down moaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding
that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came
near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and
Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the
pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon
able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the Lion took
Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live.
But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave
was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without
food for several days. The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle,
and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon the Lion was let
loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as
soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon
him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised at this,
summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the slave
was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest. Gratitude
is the sign of noble souls.</span></p>
