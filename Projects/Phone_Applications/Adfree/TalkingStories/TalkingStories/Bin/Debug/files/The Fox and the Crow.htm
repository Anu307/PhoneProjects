font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of
cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree. &quot;That's for me, as I
am a Fox,&quot; said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.
&quot;Good-day, Mistress Crow,&quot; he cried. &quot;How well you are looking
to-day: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice
must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one
song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.&quot; The Crow lifted
up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the
piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Fox.
&quot;That will do,&quot; said he. &quot;That was all I wanted. In exchange for
your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future .&quot;Do not
trust flatterers.&quot;</span></p>
