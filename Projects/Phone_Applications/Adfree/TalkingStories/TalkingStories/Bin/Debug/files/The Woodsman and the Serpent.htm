<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>One wintry day a Woodsman was tramping home from
his work when he saw something black lying on the snow. When he came closer he
saw it was a Serpent to all appearance dead. But he took it up and put it in
his bosom to warm while he hurried home. As soon as he got indoors he put the
Serpent down on the hearth before the fire. The children watched it and saw it
slowly come to life again. Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but the
Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child
to death. So the Woodsman seized his axe, and with one stroke cut the Serpent
in two. &quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;No gratitude from the wicked.&quot;</span></p>
