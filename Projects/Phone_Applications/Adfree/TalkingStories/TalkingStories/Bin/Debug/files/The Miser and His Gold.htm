<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>Once upon a time there was a Miser who used to
hide his gold at the foot of a tree in his garden; but every week he used to go
and dig it up and gloat over his gains. A robber, who had noticed this, went
and dug up the gold and decamped with it. When the Miser next came to gloat
over his treasures, he found nothing but the empty hole. He tore his hair, and
raised such an outcry that all the neighbours came around him, and he told them
how he used to come and visit his gold. &quot;Did you ever take any of it
out?&quot; asked one of them. &quot;Nay,&quot; said he, &quot;I only came to
look at it.&quot; &quot;Then come again and look at the hole,&quot; said a
neighbour; &quot;it will do you just as much good.&quot; Wealth unused might as
well not exist.</span></p>
