<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>A Farmer one day came to the stables to see to
his beasts of burden: among them was his favourite Ass, that was always well
fed and often carried his master. With the Farmer came his Lapdog, who danced
about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be. The Farmer
felt in his pocket, gave the Lapdog some dainty food, and sat down while he
gave his orders to his servants. The Lapdog jumped into his master's lap, and
lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears. The Ass, seeing this,
broke loose from his halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of the
Lapdog. The Farmer could not hold his sides with laughter, so the Ass went up
to him, and putting his feet upon the Farmer's shoulder attempted to climb into
his lap. The Farmer's servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon
taught the Ass that .Clumsy jesting is no joke.</span></p>
