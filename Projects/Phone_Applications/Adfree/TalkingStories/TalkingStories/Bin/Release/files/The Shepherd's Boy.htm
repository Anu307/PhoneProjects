<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended
his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely
for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little
company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out
&quot;Wolf, Wolf,&quot; and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of
them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much
that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers
came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the
forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out
&quot;Wolf, Wolf,&quot; still louder than before. But this time the villagers,
who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and
nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy's
flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said: &quot;A
liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.&quot;</span></p>
