<p class=style8 align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:
13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>At a country fair there was a Buffoon who
made all the people laugh by imitating the cries of various animals. He
finished off by squeaking so like a pig that the spectators thought that he had
a porker concealed about him. But a Countryman who stood by said: &quot;Call
that a pig s squeak! Nothing like it. You give me till tomorrow and I will show
you what it's like.&quot; The audience laughed, but next day, sure enough, the
Countryman appeared on the stage, and putting his head down squealed so
hideously that the spectators hissed and threw stones at him to make him stop.
&quot;You fools!&quot; he cried, &quot;see what you have been hissing,&quot;
and held up a little pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter the
squeals. Men often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing.</span></p>
