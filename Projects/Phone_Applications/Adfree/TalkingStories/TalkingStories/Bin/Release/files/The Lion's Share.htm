<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Georgia","serif"'>The Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox,
the Jackal, and the Wolf. They hunted and they hunted till at last they
surprised a Stag, and soon took its life. Then came the question how the spoil
should be divided. &quot;Quarter me this Stag,&quot; roared the Lion; so the
other animals skinned it and cut it into four parts. Then the Lion took his
stand in front of the carcass and pronounced judgment: The first quarter is for
me in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter; another
share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the fourth quarter,
well, as for that, I should like to see which of you will dare to lay a paw
upon it.&quot; &quot;Humph,&quot; grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his
tail between his legs; but he spoke in a low growl .&quot;You may share the
labours of the great, but you will not share the spoil.&quot;</span></p>
